I have also tried Komik, but noticed that the images are blurry when scrolling and takes a second for it to sharpen. ACV does not have this problem! One feature that this app desperately needs, however, is full screen support (which Komik has). Please add full screen support for those running Kit Kat and this will be the perfect comic reader :D",Chris,2014-04-03T22:00:00.000Z,4,INFORMATION_GIVING

CBZ files are working fine. no error. There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use ""Calibre"" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once.

ObjectId(572912b5507c69054da8e3e2),MultiPicture Live Wallpaper,0.6.11,ralph9250 I was very disappointed. I had a old Samsung Infuse and the application worked great. I had 3000+ pictures and they rotated between the 7 screens. A different picture on each screen. I had that phone for almost 3 years. This year I treated myself for Christmas and bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I am so disappointed because I cannot get the application to switch pictures when I change screens. I read in your report that this seems to be a problem with the Galaxy S series. FIX IT!,Ralph Martin,2014-12-25T23:00:00.000Z,3,INFORMATION_GIVING

ObjectId(572912c9507c69054da8e3f9),MultiPicture Live Wallpaper,0.6.11,"Does as it says, but not well To get a single picture to work correctly, you have to manually navigate (using an installed file explorer) to where that picture is located instead of using the built in selection. It also will not let you set the position for wallpapers larger than your display, and there isn't a setting to enable the ""moving background"" that is standard on Android for normal wallpapers. Many of the transitions do not work; many of them occurred even when moving between different pages of my home screen that had the same settings. Crossfade didn't work when unlocking my phone. The wallpaper faded to black and then faded the new wallpaper in. This would probably be acceptable if the animation was in any way smooth. In summary, this app has some neat features that ""work,"" but some of them don't work and the ones that do never seem to work well. Didn't use it long enough to see if it impacts battery life.

I have beaten it with the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes, the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise.

That was until all my decks just disappeared. Now, why would I want to use the application without anything to practice?! Update 2/14/2016 I thought that this was caused by a automatic update to a version that forced a logging into the site to use any features. Or at least all that was prompted for was to login to the site, and the decks showed zero. I had built a few decks. I feel that maybe for an Open Source project still alive, I judged to harshly after my initial shock. I'm still going to have to dig through old storage backups for any possible files. I already deleted the application on the phone. 5/3/2016 I was able to remove the /storage/sdcard0/AnkiDroid/ folder. Install the Application again. Next, I restored the last copy of the folder before the card sets disappeared. Then started the application and the cards all showed-up again.

Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit.

This app allows lots of customization options. Muzei also has endless extensions so you will never be bored with the same old photos again. I've experienced no major battery drain and no bugs.

ObjectId(5729c178507c690b8e0bd554),Clip Stack ✓ Clipboard Manager,1.7.6,"Clip Stack surely does the job it proclaims to execute. However, there isn't much value in the application because a typical ""Notepad"" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file. It would have been awesome if the contextual clipboard is presented with the option to pick up the values from ""Clip Stack"". For instance, I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values, it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that, WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field, it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from ""Clip Stack"", which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But, such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features. Application design surely is commendable. But, unless the aforementioned feature has been added, we would not be finding it usable.",Raja Jeevan Kumar Maduri,2016-02-27T23:00:00.000Z,2,OTHER

THANK YOU. In my head it yields: ""Make it work, but keep it simple"", which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service.

ObjectId(5729c1d9507c690b8e0bd5a2),ConnectBot,1.8.6,Great App I use this to connect to compute servers primarily to monitor jobs. One improvement I'd suggest is better screen management with landscape orientation. It's difficult to use vi or sed to edit scripts with a touch phone keyboard that hogs half the screen space. I don't think the screen can be scrolled but maybe I didn't figure out how. Public key management works well. THANKS !,mike hinkleman,2016-04-29T22:00:00.000Z,4,OTHER
