CBZ files are working fine. no error. There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use ""Calibre"" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once.

It also will not let you set the position for wallpapers larger than your display, and there isn't a setting to enable the ""moving background"" that is standard on Android for normal wallpapers. Many of the transitions do not work; many of them occurred even when moving between different pages of my home screen that had the same settings. Crossfade didn't work when unlocking my phone. The wallpaper faded to black and then faded the new wallpaper in. This would probably be acceptable if the animation was in any way smooth. In summary, this app has some neat features that ""work,"" but some of them don't work and the ones that do never seem to work well. Didn't use it long enough to see if it impacts battery life.

I have beaten it with the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes, the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise.

Ive gotten a few friends on board so its great for messaging them but also for regular texting. One complaint. I learned there was a character limit the hard way. Took me 23 minutes to type a story to my friend and it's all done and finished. But when I sent it, it only sent half of what I typed. It would have been better if it stopped letting me type when this limit was reached.",Ian Fred,2016-04-20T22:00:00.000Z,5,FEATURE_REQUEST

Or at least all that was prompted for was to login to the site, and the decks showed zero. I had built a few decks. I feel that maybe for an Open Source project still alive, I judged to harshly after my initial shock. I'm still going to have to dig through old storage backups for any possible files. I already deleted the application on the phone. 5/3/2016 I was able to remove the /storage/sdcard0/AnkiDroid/ folder. Install the Application again.

ObjectId(57291a6e507c69054da8eb0b),Financius - Expense Manager,0.19.7,"I used Financius for about a year and a half, replacing Spendee. Financius was the best expense manager that I had seen during the time I was using it. Once I encountered another app called Expense Manager, it became a tossup on which one was better. Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit. So I prefer Financius for the reporting and UI, but Expense Manager for the functionality.

However, there isn't much value in the application because a typical ""Notepad"" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file.

For instance, I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values, it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that, WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field, it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from ""Clip Stack"", which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But, such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features.

This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation, but only to support you, not to unlock extra features, as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply, you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: ""Make it work, but keep it simple"", which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available. Respect for you ""guys"". I will of course rate you on Google play store.
