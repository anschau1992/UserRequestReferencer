57a08ae05623ed0942ed7edf;I used Financius for about a year and a half, replacing Spendee. Financius was the best expense manager that I had seen during the time I was using it. Once I encountered another app called Expense Manager, it became a tossup on which one was better. Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit. So I prefer Financius for the reporting and UI, but Expense Manager for the functionality. If Financius were to add widgets, it would reign supreme for me again.;OTHER;

57a101555623ed112dfbe304;Worked just fine for a long time until now and made me almost buy a new phone I used this app for a long time on my Asus Zenfone 5. About 1 month ago, mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly, the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes, makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app, because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers;COMPATIBILITY;DEVICE

57a101565623ed112dfbe32d;5Stars and highest donation 1) I don't only contact developers when having a problem or a request with an application, I also do so when being seriously impressed, which are the case with your 'ClipStack' application. This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation, but only to support you, not to unlock extra features, as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply, you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: 'Make it work, but keep it simple', which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available. Respect for you 'guys'. I will of course rate you on Google play store.  Yasemin Nielsen, Denmark/Norway;PRICING;PRICE
