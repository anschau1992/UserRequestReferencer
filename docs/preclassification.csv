57a074075623ed07ff09d3fa;Awesome The search engine is actually pretty good and if I want to searh on any other website, there is a short cut. Also there are no ads and it informs me when I'm looking for a website, but putting right next to the link, "Official Website." I also love the consistency that whenever I search on any device the same search, the same results pop out. It's unbiased.
57a074075623ed07ff09d3fb;biased news heavy to the left.

57a074075623ed07ff09d3fd;Great! But where are the ducks?
57a074085623ed07ff09d3fe;Tabs? Works as a browser should. Maybe add tabs option? Sometimes I wanna open a new window to search something can't do that on here.
57a074085623ed07ff09d3ff;Replacer I want to supplant my Google as default with this.
57a074085623ed07ff09d400;Top Suggestions ! Please, add DuckDuckGo in Android share menu. So, we can open browser links directly in this app.
57a074085623ed07ff09d401;The best Recommendation 4 u to use this search engine
57a0740a5623ed07ff09d402;Loved it Making internet not just simple but also also smarter. Thanks !Duck.
57a0740a5623ed07ff09d403;Best ever. Now, I can browse in safety without the Illuminati spying on me.
57a0740a5623ed07ff09d404;BEST SEARCH ENGINE! this is a REAL quick search :) i also love the TOR intergration and javascript feature no one else has this ;)
57a0740a5623ed07ff09d405;Love DDG No bullshit, great search results.
57a0740f5623ed07ff09d406;Great, but hardly works on wifi I've enjoyed this app by day for the nice feed of stories, but when I want to use it as a browser over Wi-Fi at home, it just does not work or even load any search results 90% of the time. It just hangs like there's no signal. If I turn off Wi-Fi, it works flawlessly. I want this to be my browser..
57a0740f5623ed07ff09d407;Great for when the Google search bubble doesn't have what you need I use this app frequently. It's always good to be able to search without your results being tailored to your account.
57a0740f5623ed07ff09d408;ZTE Prestige I got more results quicker than the ordinary search engines and no advertisements or viruses. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because there's always room for improvement. Keep up the good work!

57a074125623ed07ff09d40a;So smooth on HTC 10, 6.1 Compaird to Dolphin,chrome,Duck duck go works like a charm,option to add to home screen would top it off..
57a074125623ed07ff09d40b;Deep Web Who else came here for deep web browsing
57a074125623ed07ff09d40c;EXCELLENT!!!üëçüëç
57a074125623ed07ff09d40d;Best Use this as your default search engine! Finally a search engine that doesn't track you and sell your searches. Take that government
57a074145623ed07ff09d40e;Amazing Does what you want perfectly.
57a074145623ed07ff09d40f;i like this search engine
57a074145623ed07ff09d410;Great This search engine doesn't remove negative results for hillary Clinton like Google does. Google is worse than China now. If that doesn't bother you then you love slavery.
57a074145623ed07ff09d411;Faster and safer than google The best alternative to Google/Google Chrome I've ever used !!!!
57a074145623ed07ff09d412;Great alternative, private browser Really needs tabs though.
57a074155623ed07ff09d413;Awsome Could run smoother.
57a074155623ed07ff09d414;loved it privacy no unwanted ads
57a074155623ed07ff09d415;Great Been using over a week now and so glad to have found it. Quick, responsive. I like it because it isn't Google.
57a074155623ed07ff09d416;My favorite search engine It offers pages not found with other √®ngin√®?
57a074155623ed07ff09d417;Very good both for content & function
57a0741a5623ed07ff09d418;No more ads :-) Thanks to DuckDuckgo, I can search without ads and spam ^^
57a0741a5623ed07ff09d419;Its ok App keeps shutting its self down iv now decided to remove this app as it keeps crashing
57a0741a5623ed07ff09d41a;Best Search Engine With Google recently being found to have suppressed negative Clinton searches without suppressing negative Trump or Bernie searches, it makes me glad to have switched to DuckDuckGo a long time ago.
57a0741a5623ed07ff09d41b;Tor Does not connect to orfox
57a0741c5623ed07ff09d41c;LOllYGAGER ROXY ROSE AWSM!!!!!
57a0741c5623ed07ff09d41d;Really like the layout ,good ,news and all else line up.
57a0741c5623ed07ff09d41e;Invaluable privacy tool Great search engine that dosen't track and store your searches or cookie you all over the clear web. A must have for advocates of privacy.
57a0741c5623ed07ff09d41f;Great. Needs auto voice search option though. Needs the option to auto open voice prompt as you open the app. Other than that, great app. Nice to go Googleless.
57a0741c5623ed07ff09d420;Better than Google
57a0741d5623ed07ff09d421;Great Quick Access Then !-terms are a very fast way to query for relevant stuff.
57a0741f5623ed07ff09d422;Awesome Do what it says ! Always something interesting to read
57a0741f5623ed07ff09d423;WOW!!! The people,places and info is only limited by what you search for.
57a0741f5623ed07ff09d424;Great! Good but I hate the fact that it downloads the files into its data instead of in a folder which can be accessed
57a0741f5623ed07ff09d425;Great I love it.
57a0741f5623ed07ff09d426;Bay Great site
57a074225623ed07ff09d427;I use this all the time Am excited to try the app, but have used this search engine for a few years.
57a074225623ed07ff09d428;Great company and product Hope they keep it about the users and don't go the way of Google, but then ii supposed there'd just be another ddg to take its place.
57a074225623ed07ff09d429;Excellent The world doesn't know it, but this is what we all need.
57a074225623ed07ff09d42a;Is the deep web on here Whoops
57a074235623ed07ff09d42b;browser often redircts to blank page. search egine is brutal. Love the stories on home page but the infomercials on apple are a bit much.

57a074235623ed07ff09d42f;Duckduckgo Search engine
57a074265623ed07ff09d430;Can not get connection post Marshmallow Frustrated with app trying to use Torbot with Tor enabled post M upgrade on S5.
57a074265623ed07ff09d431;Works as advertised Keeps the dick heads at bay somewhat
57a074265623ed07ff09d432;Dare I use anything but chrome? Yes, DuckDuckGo offers a great comparable search engine yes there are many featured Google products that are much better but at least a discreet search option exist when you need the privacy
57a074265623ed07ff09d433;Nexus 6 Doesn't connect to tor anymore on my nexus 6 running android n dp4
57a074285623ed07ff09d434;Thank you very much.
57a074285623ed07ff09d435;Good but cant add tabs
57a074285623ed07ff09d436;Google/sprint May be an app, but Sprint still keeps a record of everything you search...so why bother?
57a074285623ed07ff09d437;All Of My Dreams... It's fast, efficient and such a clean UI, that it is now ubiquitous on my devices. I didn't think software like this was still being written. Thank you.
57a0742a5623ed07ff09d438;Use DuckDuckGo, not Google DuckDuckGo will not spy on you like Google does, DuckDuckGo works better than Google with more security and privacy
57a0742a5623ed07ff09d439;Duck Omg the best/works excellent with private lol
57a0742a5623ed07ff09d43a;Great browser but... It really need some tabs.
57a0742a5623ed07ff09d43b;Unbiased Great search engine that actually filters according to popularity and not on what the developers want. I am getting results more similar to day to day conversations instead of an aagenda Works great!
57a0742b5623ed07ff09d43c;Can be trusted Unlike Google who alters results to protect political figures and who knows who else
57a0742b5623ed07ff09d43d;@ mad hatter you conveniently left apple,perhaps the most sophisticated covert info gatherer out of your list.
57a0742b5623ed07ff09d43e;SImilar to Protection Genuinely a lifesaver as it keeps my.internet time absolutely faptastic.
57a0742b5623ed07ff09d43f;Just fantastic:

57a0742d5623ed07ff09d444;Good one for !bang search Easy to use and customizable
57a0742d5623ed07ff09d445;The best! It works so well!! I love all of its features. It works so much faster than Google Chrome, which bricks my phone. Honestly, you could leave the app how it is, without any additions or changes and I would STILL love it!
57a074305623ed07ff09d446;Best Best app I've tested in a long time
57a074305623ed07ff09d447;Love it! It's one of those few Apps you 'll love to have!

57a074305623ed07ff09d449;No option of multiple tabs
57a074335623ed07ff09d44a;Only just ok Doesn't open multiple tabs like every other browser available. Would rate higher for this feature.
57a074335623ed07ff09d44b;The best search engine!! I use this on my computer. I has less ads. All around awesome browser.
57a074335623ed07ff09d44c;Good for üé∂ This app is good if you whant to here your favorite song
57a074335623ed07ff09d44d;Great browser, best privacy, lacking in scholarly searches I am very pleased with this app and duckduckgo as a whole. My only concern is that looking up scholarly articles and scientific information outside of wikipedia is a good deal easier on Google. I understand why this is the case and wait patiently for DDG to catch up to Google on this front!
57a074345623ed07ff09d44e;AMAZING!!! :-)
57a074355623ed07ff09d454;Loved it! Great app
57a074345623ed07ff09d44f;Butifull serch app and faster
57a074345623ed07ff09d450;Great stuff. Love the homepage layout Great app. Feels private. Could you make a widget for Android? That would be much more convenient.
57a074345623ed07ff09d451;Fantastic I won't search without it.
57a074345623ed07ff09d452;Duckduckgo Only one permission, unlike Google and shitbook.
57a074355623ed07ff09d453;Great one! Works well. No issues encountered
57a074355623ed07ff09d455;Needs a stop button.
57a074355623ed07ff09d456;Excellent Way to Go I love this browser. Privacy is the way to go...
57a074355623ed07ff09d457;Amazing Great app guys.and you should improve the speed of net little bit. And living that no problem
57a074365623ed07ff09d458;Informative
57a074365623ed07ff09d459;Great I love this because this browser is safe
57a074365623ed07ff09d45a;DuckDuckGo can!!!
57a074365623ed07ff09d45b;Best search engine after google
57a074365623ed07ff09d45c;What a spiffing app Yer its good.
57a074365623ed07ff09d45d;Nice Voice search would be a nice add
57a074395623ed07ff09d45e;Not working, Error no connection is what it keeps saying, I use my Google browser And it works fine so I know it's not my phone connection
57a074395623ed07ff09d45f;Amazing I use this every single day I had no problems with it
57a074395623ed07ff09d460;This app is crap! It has nothing to do with Tor. It doesn't function like Tor, as Tor Browser is one of the fastest browsers around. I went to a site and tried to download a simple Anime. And I couldn't get the screen to enlarge, without it trying to load a toatle dif page.
57a074395623ed07ff09d461;Deleted... It would probably be great if it ever loaded in under 40 seconds...
57a0743b5623ed07ff09d462;Best Most Amazing search engine Best search engine, doesn't track you while your search, and a nice little news feed too.
57a0743b5623ed07ff09d463;Best search engine and great browser
57a0743b5623ed07ff09d464;The Better Search Engine. All companies want to spy on us. Everytime we read an email, browse the web and even search for a website, or a question, someone is watching you. The companies are Google, Microsoft, Facebook and The NSA. They all want to know everything about you. Your daily routine, where you live, etc. DuckDuckGo isn't like that. They're the complete opposite. You should get your privacy and they believe that. Use DuckDuckGo and remain Anonymous.
57a0743d5623ed07ff09d465;Great app, but maybe add an option that will only take you to mobile sites. Other then that brilliant app üòä
57a0743d5623ed07ff09d466;Doesnt run...
57a0743d5623ed07ff09d467;Best search engine, it need an ad blocker plugin like ghostery to be 5 stars
57a0743d5623ed07ff09d468;Do not use this app
57a0743d5623ed07ff09d469;Ty ty ty ty ty All praise the might duckduckgo. It replaces g$$ gle search. I swear to remain faithful to ddg.
57a0743e5623ed07ff09d46a;Great browser, search app, news reader, link saver... Many different functions in one app w/ a very attractive, modern UI
57a0743e5623ed07ff09d46b;Yep #1
57a0743e5623ed07ff09d46c;Poor performance versus using DDG in browser DuckDuckGo is great to use, but I cannot recommend using the app itself. Web searches are way too slow to process versus using the search engine in Firefox.
57a0743e5623ed07ff09d46d;Love
57a074415623ed07ff09d46e;Amazing But... There is an annoying glitch. Every time I click on a pitcure it asks me which browser to use. And when I hit back somai can get to the pic, it takes a very long time to load. Plzzz fix, and thanks for making this app:)
57a074415623ed07ff09d46f;Awasome
57a074415623ed07ff09d470;Great privacy! Awesome. Definitely the company has a great future. Privacy is indeed taking much concern in recent years. Great work dev. Looking forward for a much light-faster app.

57a074435623ed07ff09d474;best browser ever its really safe and cool it even has its own widget
57a074435623ed07ff09d475;I think its sneaky and shady Private browsing
57a074435623ed07ff09d476;Nope Nope
57a0744a5623ed07ff09d477;This is the best Free Non-Tracking search application to use on the Web. Google, Bing, Yahoo, Dog pile, AOL etc track and record EVERYTHING YOU WERE EVER SEARCHING FOR. No thanks I will only use DUCKDUCKGO as they "understand what Privacy TRULY IS." They do not lie about Any of the Services that they provide "unlike the others" such as, Bing, Google, Yahoo, Dog pile, AOL etc. Excetera
57a0744a5623ed07ff09d478;Peace of mind. No ads popping up. Saved important searchs. Gives me a freedom I did not realize was important to me.imagine not doing a search because u don't want pictured ads of cough medicine flashing in your news feeds. I gave proven This app does not track me. Enjoy the freedom!
57a0744a5623ed07ff09d479;Much loooooovee :)

57a0744e5623ed07ff09d481;The best This has the best non tracking tool in the appstore.
57a0744e5623ed07ff09d482;Awesome Good results
57a0744e5623ed07ff09d483;Widget serves no purpose Can't type into the search widget so what is the point. All it does is launch the browser.

57a0744f5623ed07ff09d488;Great browser, useful tools - BUT The constant barrage of pop-up advertising is bloody annoying. This is a new thing for DDG and entirely unwelcome. 3 stars for the irritation.
57a074525623ed07ff09d489;No black theme Unfortunately it doesn't have a black theme
57a074525623ed07ff09d48a;Awesome Thanks!!!
57a074525623ed07ff09d48b;When the duck reinvent searching Duckduckgo has found the best way to keep you informed on alla that matters on the web and even more it keeps you learning things you wouldn't even think to seek for.

57a074535623ed07ff09d491;looved it Best search engine.
57a074565623ed07ff09d492;Works but why app? Why is it necessary? I get it IF it was an option but the fact is it's mandatory to get full search functions (images, maps) on Android. It's as if they leave these functions out of the Web app & browser integration to extort downloads. Oh, and wtf is up with no way to close it?!
57a074565623ed07ff09d493;Nice app Thank
57a074565623ed07ff09d494;The best search engine! Duck it, forget the rest.
57a074565623ed07ff09d495;Love it but The app uses a lot of background data and a lot of background battery. Love everything but this hope this is fixed in an update.
57a0745a5623ed07ff09d496;Why do we need Tor? To surf internet i need extra app to use,battery will drain so fast

57a0745a5623ed07ff09d498;Searching the way it was meant too be My results are much more in correlation with my search request and what's best it's without ads and not trying to anticipate my results from historical patterns... Thank you

57a0745c5623ed07ff09d49b;I love the stories feature but it crashes multiple times every day in the half hour I have to read it! Very frustrating!!
57a0745c5623ed07ff09d49c;Better than Google Because Google is the üòà

57a0745e5623ed07ff09d4a0;Really like the idea But keyboard interactions are funky, hard to edit your search. Also doesn't play well with some browsers, notably orfox. Used on one plus two using marshmallow

57a0745e5623ed07ff09d4a2;A query How to open a link in a new tab? It just opens in the same tab...

57a074625623ed07ff09d4aa;F**kin Sound as a ¬£1
57a074625623ed07ff09d4ab;Not bad Very good when it works! When paired with Orbot, it often seems to trip up and time out, even with a full signal of perfectly good internet access. It also will refuse to load various pages, seemingly at random...still, in spite of these issues, it's pretty nifty and generally usable!
57a074655623ed07ff09d4ac;Easy and Fast Super Fast and really easy to use. Goes head to head with Google, doing better in most areas. The browser is superb and has a reading mode to remove the clutter of ads and such and displays the text. Makes viewing news articles really easy. Love this app.
57a074655623ed07ff09d4ad;Need a change from Google This is good
57a074655623ed07ff09d4ae;OK app Ducks is most mendacious of character s, please make a nother name,down load was fastest yet, all the strars for this one!!!!!
57a074655623ed07ff09d4af;I love this app thank u so much.
57a0746a5623ed07ff09d4b0;The obvious choice of browser It delivers great results in a timely manner. Good show, creators of duckduckgo!
57a0746a5623ed07ff09d4b1;full of ads
57a0746a5623ed07ff09d4b2;This is app has a very special place :D I've been using this app for quite a while and proud to say I just love this app.For people who say its slow you must remember to get something great we have to sacrifice something else ..and from last updates It's way faster then previous version!! PS: To devs if theme of app is slightly dark then it will be very helpful for a long duration use :D @duckduckGo!!
57a0746a5623ed07ff09d4b3;Needs tabs and change theme option
57a0746c5623ed07ff09d4b4;The best.
57a0746c5623ed07ff09d4b5;DuckDuckR+DuckDuckGo Search & Stories Likely look style Pictures and Email.
57a0746c5623ed07ff09d4b6;Still tracks you The browser is still tracking my searches even after i turned off autocomplete
57a0746c5623ed07ff09d4b7;Tor not working. Problems with staying on Tor, at random it's connecting without it. It should be forced, like this you don't know when it stopped.
57a0746e5623ed07ff09d4b8;Theme Is there a theme option similar to the desktop..I'm not a big fan of the default search results?
57a0746e5623ed07ff09d4b9;Great app I love it!
57a0746e5623ed07ff09d4ba;Nice app! Well it's a nice app providing anonymity but I don't think the world needs yet another browser if DuckDuckGo could provide some OK Google like features it would be great!
57a0746e5623ed07ff09d4bb;Best
57a074705623ed07ff09d4bc;Great job! I feel tons more secure browsing the web, this is a truely awesome app. Now I don't have that voice in the back of my head telling me that i'm going to get caught, although there's no reason to... üëå
57a074705623ed07ff09d4bd;No themes?? What? No themes?? I want a black theme like the pc browser!!! :(
57a074705623ed07ff09d4be;Sloww. dead sloww.
57a074705623ed07ff09d4bf;Ad Blocker Please. Good and quick, an ad blocker in the built in browser would make it perfect.
57a074705623ed07ff09d4c0;Ok Good
57a074735623ed07ff09d4c1;Amazing This is like the best app ever. It has for support built in which is great. It is basically a full browser wish I could use it instead of Google but there is some good stuff Google has
57a074765623ed07ff09d4c2;Finds everything The app finds everything the Google search app does, but this one does not track you. That alone makes this my frequent go to search app.
57a074765623ed07ff09d4c3;Great search engine
57a074765623ed07ff09d4c4;No.1 non tracking search app Used this after Google tax dodge really annoyed me. Found it just as good for my needs.
57a074765623ed07ff09d4c5;Works well, discreet. In a world where "Big Brother" watches everything we do, DuckDuckGo is one of the "key" pieces to keeping a user's searches private... And with the integrated Tor support, this is completely achievable (requires the third-party Tor applications). Highly recommended, to all.
57a074785623ed07ff09d4c6;Icon is now shown in Google Swipe. Thank you. Search results could be better tho
57a074785623ed07ff09d4c7;Most useful One of my favorite apps.
57a074785623ed07ff09d4c8;Good app, but needs tabs, preferably like the tabs in Firefox's browser. That is the last thing holding me back from using duck as my primary browser.
57a074785623ed07ff09d4c9;Don't track us
57a074785623ed07ff09d4ca;Thanks Thanks for ousting Google. Great app!!
57a074795623ed07ff09d4cb;Awesome! Bye bye google!
57a074895623ed07ff09d4cc;Works Good
57a074895623ed07ff09d4cd;Good and simple jabber client. But has no spam controls, which is annoying.
57a074895623ed07ff09d4ce;V .NiCe aPp
57a074895623ed07ff09d4cf;Drains battery It's the top draining application on my phone, despite not using it most of the time. Makes it essentially unusable.
57a0748e5623ed07ff09d4d0;My personal favorite XMPP+OTR app for Android, aside from a few minor issues I've had but have been able to solve. It allows for a large amount of customization for more advanced users while still remaining straightforward and simple to use for less advanced users. For the record, I've tried ChatSecure and Conversations too, but ChatSecure seems buggy and doesn't offer the option to not log conversations and Conversations has an issue where every time it disconnects, it gets stuck trying to load my contact list until I kill it and open it again.
57a0748e5623ed07ff09d4d1;The app failed to Connect on my phone It keeps diconection, since I downloaded a week ago
57a0748e5623ed07ff09d4d2;Does not work on Android L onwards Does not work on Android L onwards. Works fine on Android kit kat
57a074905623ed07ff09d4d3;Handles multi-user chats (MUCs) and end-to-end message encryption (OTR) better than any chat app I've used on mobile.
57a074905623ed07ff09d4d4;Gr8 Great app, works perfectly, and new version has nice UI, way better than other xmpp clients for Android. &lt;3
57a074905623ed07ff09d4d5;Great, with one flaw Great job, but please give the option to make the persistent notification a low priority so that it's normally hidden from view and only visible on pull-down.
57a074905623ed07ff09d4d6;It automatically added server address with user name. Setings should be manual.
57a074925623ed07ff09d4d7;Can't adjust alert volume, conferences have no sender names. Possibly the worst xmpp client I've ever dealt with.
57a074925623ed07ff09d4d8;Good, but Need image and file transfer support..
57a074925623ed07ff09d4d9;Skype is missing How to add my Skype account in this jabber?
57a074925623ed07ff09d4da;Liked it but it always goes offline, when I don't use it. It used to work until some update on my xiaomi phone destroyed this feature.
57a074965623ed07ff09d4db;Issue with .onion addresses Xabber won't resolve .onion address (Tor hidden services) works fine on chat secure...

57a074975623ed07ff09d4de;Needs to be updated. Google has disabled logging in through the app since it does not use a supported authentication mechanism. I'm still going to leave a 5-star feedback because of how well designed the app is. Developer, please fix the authentication issue. -- Old Review -- Simple yet functional. Best of all, it's open source! A dark theme would be great though. Great work.
57a074975623ed07ff09d4df;Nice app, needs file transfers
57a074975623ed07ff09d4e0;Good App Works well, seems very secure and all, would ask the developers to seriously consider adding compatibility for a panic button app.
57a074975623ed07ff09d4e1;Auto Connect After disconect cant auto connect
57a0749a5623ed07ff09d4e2;Battery Drain off the charts! Tried to use this with Olark. The battery drain is mind blowing. Sucks my battery dry in 2 hours on my S6 Edge+ making the app useless. A shame.
57a0749a5623ed07ff09d4e3;Connection error after moto e upgrade to Android 6 Was using it smoothly since one year but after software upgrade last night xabber can't connect to my corporate id. Tried multiple times after reinstall. Tested with different email ID but same error.
57a0749a5623ed07ff09d4e4;f### hangouts use this to chat with gmail contacts. has proxy support.works with wifi. best of all - this works exactly like good old gtalk.
57a0749b5623ed07ff09d4e5;I like this app but in a conference there is no indicator telling you who is saying what. The text just appears and doesn't say who the text came from.
57a0749b5623ed07ff09d4e6;Gtalk problem Cant connect to my gtalk account
57a0749b5623ed07ff09d4e7;Good, need some improvements, like some xmpp features support, reconnection when switching networks and so on, but free and working fine.
57a0749d5623ed07ff09d4e8;I love this app, just wish it was updated more often Best XMPP on android by far. Last major update was back in July and I'm still waiting for the dark theme that was temporarily removed to be brought back. Also waiting for the file transfer feature. Other than that, no complaints. This app works great on my S6 and my entire family uses it on a wide range of devices.
57a0749d5623ed07ff09d4e9;Very nice client This app has come a long way. Very slick and functional now.
57a0749d5623ed07ff09d4ea;Great App Perfect IM solution. Work with open source servers and your own *private* services. Great user interface.
57a0749f5623ed07ff09d4eb;It works flawlessly. It's probably the best. (note: I have upgraded my review from 4 to 5 stars, because the data consumption has been improved).
57a0749f5623ed07ff09d4ec;Good program. Works well and always does what I need it to do.
57a0749f5623ed07ff09d4ed;does not show images sent from other xmpp clients pl. support inline picture as chatSecure app
57a0749f5623ed07ff09d4ee;Worked perfectly fine Was looking for this app from a long time....i mean a good Xmpp app.
57a074a15623ed07ff09d4ef;Pretty Great Can't expect more from a free app
57a074a15623ed07ff09d4f0;I've been using this for a couple years. No complaints. Reviewing now as I'm coming back to install it on another phone. You'll notice a few reviews a people who have used it for a number of years, that's a good sign.
57a074a15623ed07ff09d4f1;Facebook died Well seems facebook killed for eternity the protocol xmpp. Now only give authorization error and seems nothing we can do about it. What i know is that me will not install their app full of crap permissions

57a074a45623ed07ff09d4f4;I am using it for years and it is very good. Please add authentication for running app. Thanks

57a074a45623ed07ff09d4f6;Won't let me connect to yahoo I want to love this app but every time I try to connect to yahoo it won't. How do I fix this?
57a074a45623ed07ff09d4f7;Horrible OK this app is extremely horrible don't get it
57a074a75623ed07ff09d4f8;Like it. Would give it 5 stars if it gave you a choice of a dark background also only works when both the sender and recipient is on line. Will not leave a message to be read when recipient gets on line. Apart from this fantastic app
57a074a75623ed07ff09d4f9;It's good but here's improve You can add maybe an attach or file sharing like pidgin or chatsecure? And sometimes, I can't autherization people so they get added to my list
57a074a75623ed07ff09d4fa;Best xmpp for Android
57a074a75623ed07ff09d4fb;Great Generally speaking it's great.
57a074a85623ed07ff09d4fc;Thank you!!! No more invasive FB messenger.
57a074a85623ed07ff09d4fd;Amazing Simple and easy to use
57a074a85623ed07ff09d4fe;Awesome app Before I used a stupid xmpp app for my office and now switched to xabber... Totally happy with this app. A big thanks to the developers ...
57a074a85623ed07ff09d4ff;But how? I'm so glad that this app still works, but how does it still work with Facebook if Facebook stopped XMPP support?
57a074ab5623ed07ff09d500;Needs some refinement Needs a wizard to set up a Facebook account. I can figure out how to set it up on my own, but it took some tinkering. I want to encourage my nontechnical friends to use it for Facebook, but that's kinda difficult if they can't figure out how to make it work without my help.
57a074ab5623ed07ff09d501;Best XMPP/Jabber Client Out There I've tried ChatSecure, Conversations and this. It seems to be the best and most stable and looks cleaner with more features than the other two. Highly recommended!
57a074ab5623ed07ff09d502;Love it We use this app for work. Very handy.
57a074ab5623ed07ff09d503;Nice Just jabber client that know to do the job.
57a074ac5623ed07ff09d504;problems connecting the title says it all, refuses to connect. help would be very much appreciated.
57a074ac5623ed07ff09d505;Working fine. My bad. Why only xabber and gtalk account types are possible to add? You've ruined so nice program ...... Update. Gui design changed and all account types are now under xmpp opiton.
57a074ac5623ed07ff09d506;But why i cant login with gmail
57a074ac5623ed07ff09d507;background works fine, but just add an option to choose/remove the background, like viber. no option for it kills, cos the background image pisses me off.
57a074b45623ed07ff09d508;Wonderful with an * I've been using the app for 2 years now and the update was wonderfull however i have the issue with the last word from previous message showing up and it is mega frustrating. The moment i start to type a new message the letter i typed appears twice and in between the two is the last word from the previous message. It happens when there are two concecutive messages from me. Also if on a blank row i just start erasing the last word appeares and starts gettig erased. LG G3. Please fix
57a074b45623ed07ff09d509;Great but without dark theme It's a great app, but really miss the dark theme. With new UI i think dark theme would look great.....i lower the star to 3 because there's no dark theme
57a074b65623ed07ff09d50a;HOW DO I DOWNGRADE? notifications, which worked right in the previous version, now keep repeating no matter how many times I dismiss them.it's annoying as f@ck. also, it still shows current chat user offline after you send a message, and while they're typing, "typing..." + "recipient is offline..." for fb.
57a074b65623ed07ff09d50b;Even host resolution is not written properly
57a074b65623ed07ff09d50c;Great app. I would appreciate option for bold text for new unread messages, though :-)
57a074b85623ed07ff09d50d;Nice The only issue - I couldn't find where's the password protection. Could you tell me, where it is or add it to the app, please? It would be nice for it to ask for a password to see the contacts and conversations after I press some button, lock screen or some combination, for example.
57a074b85623ed07ff09d50e;Good and efficient jabber client works great. i just have a few glitch with network flap between wifi/4g, disable/enable account is not enough, i have to exit the app and relaunch to reconnect.
57a074b85623ed07ff09d50f;Great for Openfire Played around with other pm clients and this was the best on my LGG3. I definitely would recommend. Liked it so much I paid the $3 for the VIP version.
57a074bd5623ed07ff09d510;G3 typing issues Copying the last word i type + the first letter i typed zzzzz
57a074bd5623ed07ff09d511;Great App! But can you PLZ FIX THIS 1 THING I created custom notifications under "KEY PHRASES", but every time I close, and re-open the app, it loads all the "DELETED KEY PHRASES", and overwrites the current setup. Other than that, it works perfectly for me. Please fix that one thing. Thx in advance üëç
57a074bd5623ed07ff09d512;Now that this supports multiuser chat rooms, it's a great choice. My only complaints are that the chat screen is a little inefficient with space, and that the chat server is not autodetected.
57a074bd5623ed07ff09d513;I am using it with my self installed jabberd , and this client fails with digest authentication.Other clients are working....
57a074be5623ed07ff09d514;Awsome app !!! Good Job people :-)

57a074be5623ed07ff09d517;Much improvement in 3 years I last used this app 08/2012, and a lot has changed. The app has many more features, looks much better, and runs much smoother. When compared to other modern apps, this one has a great selection of security settings. I'm very pleased with the stability and (low) battery usage.
57a074c15623ed07ff09d518;Sandy It's a nice jabber client. But please update affilation, kick and banned option of conferences in it like as in talkonaut;)
57a074c15623ed07ff09d519;It Works Good

57a074c35623ed07ff09d51c;Why would you change the UI? I used Xabber mainly because there were no ugly talkbubbles. Now I'm forced to endure them because I'm used to Xabber. Please add a setting or something! I can't even install Xabber Classic because "It's incompatible"! What the hell? Why?.. Please give us back the old no-whistles simple UI that meant business.

57a074cc5623ed07ff09d524;One suggestion Great app. Would be cleaner if the items in the overflow menu were moved to the hamburger menu.
57a074cc5623ed07ff09d525;Great App If it is possible to have file transfer that could be awesome ...thank you
57a074d25623ed07ff09d526;OK, so really don't want to give this a bad review. I have had a tweet reply from the developer, but it was not very helpful. This apps looks great, but as yet, I have been unable to connect to any chat servers! Which, kind of defeats the object of having the app. I am a syadmin for a chat server and if I cannot get my app connected to my own server, then something is very wrong. I have triple checked the settings, watched the ejabberd server logs, but this app just refuses to connect - probably something to do with the server certificate, but I have tried all combinations of the app security options and still no joy. So, I am happy to accept any help or suggestions up until Wednesday 26th August, then the app gets uninstalled. Now, that's very reasonable in my book. What does the developer think? :-)
57a074d25623ed07ff09d527;Works fine on my end, don't know how other users giving poor ratings.
57a074d45623ed07ff09d528;Lost features in update The update removed the dark theme option. Reverting to the older version until this theme option has returned. Using an AMOLED screen. Will raise to 5 stars when fixed.
57a074d45623ed07ff09d529;Flawless!! Works like charm. I used it with my xmpp servers!!
57a074d45623ed07ff09d52a;Functionally good, the new update is an improvement. The talk-bubble chat window look is terrible, however. Simple text chat windows have worked for decades, reducing usable screen space and adding a distracting background is in no way an improvement. In the least this visual mess should have an option to revert to the old, easy to read, space-efficient layout.
57a074d65623ed07ff09d52b;Aww yeah The material design update makes this the most feature rich and well designed xmpp client on the play store. 10/10 m8 would use again
57a074d65623ed07ff09d52c;Can't connect I have an Open Fire server that it won't connect to. The server is using mixed case, and this app seems to be trying to use all lower case.

57a074d85623ed07ff09d530;Otr problems should be fixed Design perfect. But otr should be fixed. Every connection change and much 'unreadable messages'. Otr is a must and without it this app useless

57a074da5623ed07ff09d534;I've just upgraded and the update is not bad, but I wish there' a way I could revert to the classic version. The old one feels faster and snappier on my phone- especially when typing. Plus I miss the original interface. I hope Xabber gives us the option to go back to the old version (e.g. uninstall update). Can anyone please help?
57a074da5623ed07ff09d535;Love the new update This messenger just plain works! Great job!

57a074df5623ed07ff09d53c;The Best!!! Awesome!!! With new interface, its beyond awesome. Please keep the keyboard after sending the message. Its get hidden and its irritating
57a074e05623ed07ff09d53d;Works great! A much easier way to use Facebook chat without having to use messenger. Works very well, looks great, and is lightweight.
57a074e05623ed07ff09d53e;Nice but On nimbuzz chatroom it's not showing users id's with msg. Why? M using s5 dous
57a074e05623ed07ff09d53f;5 stars
57a074e05623ed07ff09d540;Good improvement Been using this for a few years now. Overall big improvement to the app. I really like the new material design. However missing a dark theme is kind of a let down. No copy paste seems odd. The bubble chat is ok but would be nice to turn off to tight up the chat window.
57a074e35623ed07ff09d541;All the apps I use are slowly killing off the black background. News360, gmail, hangouts, xabber! How hard is it to keep a black background? Bring the black background back it's a required feature for any app! -1 on the rating for no black background.
57a074e35623ed07ff09d542;Ugly It is ugly and there isn't much a user can do about it. The dark mode is gone. So much space is wasted in the chat window. I regret updating.
57a074e35623ed07ff09d543;Send text by pressing enter not working...
57a074e65623ed07ff09d544;Great new look + great feature set Woah, I wasn't expecting to wake up to a Material Design UI for this. Nice work! A great new UI to go along with the already great feature set.
57a074e65623ed07ff09d545;New UI Looks very well, more usable on phones with smaller screen, but the missing dark theme is a serious miss. I hope that the update that will bring the dark theme back come very soon...
57a074e65623ed07ff09d546;Dark mode Where did it go? Went would you REMOVE functionality in an update?
57a074e65623ed07ff09d547;1.0.30 changes New color schemes are alright, not loving the chat bubbles though. Hoping for an option to turn off the bubbles and go back to the old layout for chat sessions.
57a074e85623ed07ff09d548;Best app for XMPP While there are a few little things I don't like about the new interface I've been using this for the past 3 or so years it's reliable and works very well.
57a074e85623ed07ff09d549;No dark theme?? Come on guys
57a074e85623ed07ff09d54a;How to modify the chat wallpaper? Is there any way to modify the chat background wallpaper?
57a074e85623ed07ff09d54b;Missing the dark theme Please bring back the options to change to dark background/theme.
57a074e85623ed07ff09d54c;Thanks for the redesign!
57a074eb5623ed07ff09d54d;After the last update Xabber doesn't render emoticons anymore. And I got used to smiles...
57a074eb5623ed07ff09d54e;Thank you devs so much for the new design Awesome, guys! Really, an example of smooth and fast Material UI. Totally love the colour themes, cyan one especially. Bokeh pics are great as well!
57a074eb5623ed07ff09d54f;Nice But No copy text and paste
57a074eb5623ed07ff09d550;Still works with the new update. However, unlike the previous versions, the color schemes, themes, and overall usage/look and feel of the app is now lack luster and an annoyance. If you're looking for a good look and feel, go to another app.
57a074ed5623ed07ff09d551;New chat bubble layout is a huge step back and can't disable The ios style chat bubble layout is awful, wastes screen space, cannot be disabled. Will start looking for a new xmpp app, again....
57a074ed5623ed07ff09d552;Seems faster You can turn off the weird background in chat settings. I'm missing the easy-on-the-eyes dark theme, but overall the new look is great. And it seems faster.
57a074ed5623ed07ff09d553;Really superb! Great app!
57a074ed5623ed07ff09d554;Great new design The new look gives this app a nice, fresh new feel which was long overdue! Note: according to the changelog Facebook support was removed, but it still seems to work which is good.
57a074ee5623ed07ff09d555;Nice UI What a nice UI and privacy together
57a074fe5623ed07ff09d556;Well done!! No ads, accurate!!
57a074fe5623ed07ff09d557;Don't work on samsung J5 Worked well in samsung ace3

57a074fe5623ed07ff09d559;Waste Dont use
57a075005623ed07ff09d55a;I like it Many compass apps want to start at boot and have too many permissions but not this one. Its accurate and works well and best of all has only necessary permissions! Update: this is now the 2nd best of all the ones I tested so I will keep the top 2. I still like this one a lot!
57a075005623ed07ff09d55b;Not bad But ball compass 3D is better in my opinion.
57a075005623ed07ff09d55c;Good Nice
57a075005623ed07ff09d55d;the desired one was looking for this... love it!!!
57a075035623ed07ff09d55e;wow black compass, purple background, magenta txt, no gitter, awesome, if its not working get a better phone!!!
57a075035623ed07ff09d55f;Sheikh
57a075035623ed07ff09d560;Works Works. But i thought it was gimmicky. All the positions i can hold my phone in that this compass displays usefully, my 2d compass also displays usefully. And all the positions i can hold my phone in that don't give me a useful display on my 2d compass, also don't give me a useful display on this compass. Nice idea but no real benefit over 2d compass was noticed.
57a075035623ed07ff09d561;Works pretty good right from the start After I did calibration it worked perfect. Even in the house...
57a075045623ed07ff09d562;The best compass application

57a075075623ed07ff09d56d;best app for compass and ad free ..suprb .. it's works like charm .. very accurate.
57a075075623ed07ff09d56e;Its better than all the rest Save big $$$ if you use see through function. Makes a great hand bearing compass. Its accurate enough for any use . All depends on quality of phone. Used for sailing for years. The gimbal is a great help. And with the new see through screen its the worlds best. If the see through screen was telephoto it would be perfect. This is as good as it gets on a phone
57a075075623ed07ff09d56f;It is good
57a075075623ed07ff09d570;Captain America Commercial vessel
57a075085623ed07ff09d571;Good. But missing option to select magnetic north or true north.
57a075085623ed07ff09d572;Awesome app but Works perfectly. Has fair customization. Just wanted 2 think. A little bit higher resolution of the compass itself and a simple red pointer at the top. We might not always looking for the principal directions.. great work developers. Cheers
57a075085623ed07ff09d573;awesome Help me when i am in difficult situation.
57a075085623ed07ff09d574;Ok Nice
57a075085623ed07ff09d575;Haridas Thanks this app
57a075095623ed07ff09d576;Good compass it is
57a075095623ed07ff09d577;Great compass. Use it Accurate
57a075095623ed07ff09d578;3d compass! Points north however your phone is tilted. Why settle for 2d compasses? And no annoying ads!
57a075095623ed07ff09d579;You made it excellent

57a075095623ed07ff09d57b;Marina Compass Gud app
57a0750b5623ed07ff09d57c;Simple and 3D without any adds!
57a0750b5623ed07ff09d57d;Quite good I didn't calibrate that... so I got a bad result... after calibrating, this app indicated the right direction in comparison of my real expensive compass... the difference is only 30-40 degrees... not bad indeed... ‚ò∫
57a0750c5623ed07ff09d57e;Works good. Mostly works fine. Sometimes, it shows wrong reading. Rarely. But we cannot expect more than this from a smart phone app. Its better than most apps. I recommend to download it.
57a0750c5623ed07ff09d57f;Not working It did not work on my Moto e2
57a0750c5623ed07ff09d580;Nonsense app Bekar
57a0750c5623ed07ff09d581;Best compass I love to use this compass. Easy to use and easy to read. Its working properly...
57a0750c5623ed07ff09d582;Great!
57a0750d5623ed07ff09d583;Outstanding !! Samsung Galaxy S5
57a0750d5623ed07ff09d584;Brilliant especially with the Aug camera plugin. Galaxy S4
57a0750d5623ed07ff09d585;On wear all motions are inverted, and on phone and wear compass is aprox 220 degrees off. (note 3, note edge, Moto 360)
57a0750d5623ed07ff09d586;Rubbish Moto e 2nd gen, thus app just shows a compass graphic which doesn't move! Useless.
57a0750d5623ed07ff09d587;Don't work
57a0750e5623ed07ff09d588;Rupa
57a0750e5623ed07ff09d589;Having a laugh? Is this some sort of a joke. It's just a picture of a compass. Does nothing. Motorola G2 with internet and location services enabled.
57a0750e5623ed07ff09d58a;nice its easy to handle
57a0750e5623ed07ff09d58b;Cool compass. Really nice. Love lightning launcher, that's why I tried this.
57a0750e5623ed07ff09d58c;Nice
57a0750f5623ed07ff09d58d;Wow Nice
57a0750f5623ed07ff09d58e;Love it Good
57a0750f5623ed07ff09d58f;Great! The one compass that actually works without throwing adds at you. (HTC Desire Eye)
57a0750f5623ed07ff09d590;Simple app... Easy looking... Free app of course :D
57a075115623ed07ff09d591;Didn't dislike it as it's very pretty. Problem is its just not reliable on my Sony Experia compact z3 it seems to be out by 25 degrees or so, sometimes East and at other times West. On my Moto360 watch it's upside down and North points more or less south. shame as I said the way it floats in space is pretty.
57a075115623ed07ff09d592;Excellent! Tried many compass apps but this is the first that actually points accurately! Simple but good and great design. Nexus 4 kitkat, then LG G3 Lollipop 5.0.
57a075115623ed07ff09d593;Not a marine compass Marines use gyrocompass which is non magnetic. This one is magnetic. It gets affected by iron.
57a075135623ed07ff09d594;Perfect Very good for walking as always rocks with you so you always keep a true heading no matter how you hold your phone.
57a075135623ed07ff09d595;MANU
57a075135623ed07ff09d596;Whoaaa Wow
57a075135623ed07ff09d597;Ok Nice
57a075135623ed07ff09d598;Best Compass and open source.. what more could one ask for? Oh, you want it to float magically in 3D remaining always level to the ground too? Want it to work on your Android Wear device? This dev has got you covered.
57a075155623ed07ff09d599;The best compass app I've tried so far. Finally found a compass app that gives me the same reading as my real compass! After having tried 3-4 other apps with no success, I'm glad to have found this one. Still had to hold my phone right for correct reading though. Other than that I woulda gave 5 stars.
57a075155623ed07ff09d59a;Common sense So, this compass works by detecting the phone's pitch and roll, only needing the user to adjust yaw (rotate horizontally). Thereby not having to place the phone truly flat. Makes all other compass apps useless. PERFECT
57a075155623ed07ff09d59b;Perfect app... no bloatware or advertisements...
57a075155623ed07ff09d59c;Garbage Bla bla bla
57a075165623ed07ff09d59d;Awesome Very good!
57a075165623ed07ff09d59e;Ok Nice
57a075165623ed07ff09d59f;Nice
57a075165623ed07ff09d5a0;Good Very useful
57a075165623ed07ff09d5a1;Nice
57a075165623ed07ff09d5a2;Ideal Just what I wanted. No clutter. No extra permissions needed. Simple 3D display.
57a075185623ed07ff09d5a3;don't shows the parfect direction
57a075185623ed07ff09d5a4;Lenovo P780 Wonderful, it works even in vertical position.
57a075185623ed07ff09d5a5;Lol Making fool
57a075195623ed07ff09d5a6;Works but faulty Top surface shows the right direction. Bottom side the total opposite however. Top North is aligned with bottom South and so on.
57a075195623ed07ff09d5a7;Osim lepe grafike apsolutno nepouzdan i netacan..
57a075195623ed07ff09d5a8;Ok Best
57a075195623ed07ff09d5a9;Great Little compass.
57a075195623ed07ff09d5aa;Good... Good App...
57a0751b5623ed07ff09d5ab;Just works No unnecessary permissions :) But looks ugly, you need to redo graphics.
57a0751b5623ed07ff09d5ac;No This doesn't work with my Android watch.
57a0751b5623ed07ff09d5ad;Good app
57a0751b5623ed07ff09d5ae;I Like It Extremely Accurate. I was actually taken back at how accurate it is. Cool little themes to download for free too, using the cube one. I'm using Sam Galaxy S4 Mini tho, May be different with different phone's for obvious reasons. Quality of phone and sensors and if set up right etc etc. Just letting you s4 mini users know it's ok for your sexy little phone like mine lol :)
57a0751c5623ed07ff09d5af;Just a picture

57a0751e5623ed07ff09d5b5;Awesome Thanks for a wonderful ad free compass.
57a0751e5623ed07ff09d5b6;Nice. Compass usable even when holding device vertical. 3D floating compass levels itself. Magnetic readings only (doesn't calculate True north).
57a0751e5623ed07ff09d5b7;Loose Cannon just bought this supposed? compass it does not work. it is the second one that doesn't work I don't think I will bother with any more google purchases, I have only just got my tablet. two out of two that's a good start?
57a0751e5623ed07ff09d5b8;Love it
57a075205623ed07ff09d5b9;Marine compass Use this to align my telescope to true N. Works just fine never have any problems with auto align in EQ North mode.

57a075235623ed07ff09d5c4;Marine Compass no longer works A useful app. Unfortunately, when I installed MC on my new HTC 610 Desire it no longer works - just an immobile, flat compass disc.
57a075235623ed07ff09d5c5;Gets lost! It used to work but doesn't now. You'd get horribly lost if you relied on this, it's useless. Uninstalling!
57a075235623ed07ff09d5c6;Cool Awesome 3D compass with customization. NO ADS
57a075235623ed07ff09d5c7;Excellent The 3D compass is way cool and I like the transparent mode.

I dont even normally do reviews but im so happy right now just tested this and its stopped all ads immediately.
57a0753e5623ed07ff09d5e4;No instrcutions so it doesnt work Downloaded it but alas no instructions to set it up so i had to unistall
57a0753f5623ed07ff09d5e5;Bye bye ads! Former Nexus (6) user who loves stock Android. Ads were taking up most of data... videos play automatically, half the page is an ad... I know I know, it's Google's business model. Although I have used other browsers that block ads on Nexus devices, they were all very laggy and unoptimized. Now using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with the stock Samsung browser and the result is massive. Using the internet is enjoyable again. I've also been using ABP on my desktops for years... Thank you!
57a0753f5623ed07ff09d5e6;no longer working gives me an error message and tells me to contact developer.

57a075445623ed07ff09d5eb;Doesn't do anything Followed the directions provided in app to set up, I still get a ton of ads and pop ups. It's a shame because adblock works great on windows tablets.
57a075445623ed07ff09d5ec;Shite Doesnt work. Straight away a stupid virus ad popped up to take to to some bs app in playstore. Crap
57a075445623ed07ff09d5ed;bleh blocker of unwanted content message, turned of power saving and optimization still no joy, will try next update, fresh reset days ago
57a075445623ed07ff09d5ee;Good would like an option so ads blocking is only enabled in secret mode in the browser as I normally don't mind ads (people have to make a living some way!) other than that , excellent app !
57a075475623ed07ff09d5ef;5 stars usually, but *alert*... The definition updates sent an hour ago have caused a return of the "Blocker of unwanted content not available, please contact developer" error messages to return....... (I only gave 1 star to flag the developers. Will be back to 5 when they see it.)
57a075475623ed07ff09d5f0;Not working on s7 edge I've just upgraded to s7 edge and looked at android authority website and there were 3 ads in the page I looked at. I thought adblock was meant to block these
57a075475623ed07ff09d5f1;Wipes off all annoying ads
57a075475623ed07ff09d5f2;Works well Stops those annoying pop up ads, recommended
57a075485623ed07ff09d5f3;Works great but builds up a massive cache over time. The amount of space this consumes is huge.
57a075485623ed07ff09d5f4;Doesn't seem to work well blocking ads for Samsung Internet app.
57a0754a5623ed07ff09d5f5;Completely eliminates browser lag Awesome! I can actually browse the internet on my phone now without lag thanks to this app.
57a0754a5623ed07ff09d5f6;works BUT basically it creates a huge cache of data and my phone runs out of space. switching apps if it isn't fixed.
57a0754a5623ed07ff09d5f7;Doesn't work I installed and it didn't work. Uninstalled. I will try a different app.
57a0754a5623ed07ff09d5f8;It works for me.
57a0754a5623ed07ff09d5f9;The Best!!!
57a0754d5623ed07ff09d5fa;Love it
57a0754d5623ed07ff09d5fb;Stopped working since 2 days ago Even tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times which normally resolves issues, but now won't work with the Samsung browser anymore
57a0754d5623ed07ff09d5fc;Thank you so much ! I don't write reviews for apps but this app is AMAZING!
57a0754d5623ed07ff09d5fd;Not working
57a0754d5623ed07ff09d5fe;Good but missing functionalities It works as expect but I didn't find how to configure white list, because sometimes it blocks content that shouldn't be blocked.
57a0754e5623ed07ff09d5ff;Works Great Galaxy S5 Marshmallow
57a0754e5623ed07ff09d600;S7 This doesn't work at all. Useless
57a0754e5623ed07ff09d601;Not working on Note4 It is not working on my Galaxy Note 4 version 5.1.1 with Samsung Browser version 4.0.10-53. The app cannot open the browser settings. There is no option in the browser settings, too.
57a0754e5623ed07ff09d602;Popup... Getting a popup as soon as I open the Samsung internet browser... "Blocker or unwanted content not available.."
57a0754e5623ed07ff09d603;Wow... It does nothing...
57a075505623ed07ff09d604;Seems to work now Did not work previously but ever since the update seems to work very well. Thank you
57a075505623ed07ff09d605;Awesome Yeah At last no ads for good
57a075505623ed07ff09d606;Stopped working today Seems to have stopped working completely today.
57a075505623ed07ff09d607;It's works!!! Greats app. No ads annoying me anymore. Thanks adblock.
57a075505623ed07ff09d608;Very Useful Updated my Note 4 to Marshmallow so I can finally use this. Now I can actually browse without intrusive and disruptive ads!!
57a075525623ed07ff09d609;The Ad-blocker that works w/o hurting performance It just works. Ironically the Adblock Plus add-on for the Samsung Internet Browser actually blocks ads and performs far better than the extension for Firefox for Android Browser.
57a075525623ed07ff09d60a;‚ò∫ Works like a dream
57a075525623ed07ff09d60b;Wow!!! No more adds, what more can be said.
57a075525623ed07ff09d60c;Works fine on Galaxy S7 Need to install Samsung 'Internet' browser first, then add this and configure blocking in the browser
57a075545623ed07ff09d60d;Yes! It's beautiful. Working like a charm. Thanks!
57a075545623ed07ff09d60e;Works great When I tried the pre-May 23 version on my S7 edge there was no noticeable ad blocking whatsoever.. but this version works perfectly so far...
57a075545623ed07ff09d60f;Not Working Always Shows Error On Opening Internet (Samsung browser) after the latest update its not showing any error but now it is no blocking ads. On Websites In Samsung Browser
57a075565623ed07ff09d610;Well!!! It's going great but when I browse the website it starts to slow down and some are quite quick but I would not say it's fast. My Samsung internet browser app isn't compatible so it would not work, so I guess I'll have to un-install the app.
57a075565623ed07ff09d611;Not working
57a075565623ed07ff09d612;Works Works ! Perfect
57a075565623ed07ff09d613;Seen it advertised on bbc so must be of some use. Works so far.
57a075575623ed07ff09d614;Works
57a075575623ed07ff09d615;Can't use it as it demands I update my samsung browser. Then it takes me to the app page in Google play. I'm unable to download this as it's not compatible with my system. Help please.
57a075575623ed07ff09d616;What exactly is this supposed to do? As far as I can tell this doesn't do anything.....
57a075585623ed07ff09d617;Great app!
57a075585623ed07ff09d618;I think the best app I do not identified another better
57a075585623ed07ff09d619;Doesn't work for everything
57a075585623ed07ff09d61a;Works great
57a0755a5623ed07ff09d61b;Works well but needs a reinstall on each version Great app but stopped blocking with the new update, had to reinstall to get it to work again.

Unfortunately though, the app landscape has filled out and moved on with time. It was lean, though a bit glitchy when dealing with archives, but despite all the years minor bugs were never fixed. The changing nature of Android has broken this app further, and the developers dumped the source code hoping outsiders would develop the program for them, while they reaped the benefits. It's been over three years since the code has been touched.
57a076fc5623ed07ff09d70d;Lag fest garbage app
57a076fc5623ed07ff09d70e;Cant open cbr files Hated it
57a076fd5623ed07ff09d70f;Good This only one app good for comic reader other r ridicules
57a076fd5623ed07ff09d710;Not for marshmallow Can't access SD card for marshmallow.
57a076fd5623ed07ff09d711;Junk, don't bother with this app. Corrupted CBR files, gave "out of memory" error msgs when that wasn't the prob. Really, how hard is it to untar jpgs and display them??? Answer, not very...
57a076fd5623ed07ff09d712;Great app, but sometimes it don't open files.....
57a076fd5623ed07ff09d713;Landscape mode as default.... On a comic reader?
57a076ff5623ed07ff09d714;Hate this app Hate this app
57a076ff5623ed07ff09d715;Galaxy s3 Horrible at reading the files. Messed up too many times.
57a076ff5623ed07ff09d716;Used to be great I've used ACV for years and once loved it. But lately it gives me out of memory errors no matter the file size, format, location, whatever. I'm sorry to say I've abandoned it.
57a076ff5623ed07ff09d717;Become completely glitchy after the third comic i read. Too bad, i love the simplicity and it do the job without useless options.
57a077015623ed07ff09d718;Generally, I find that this is the best comic reader available. Aside from a few bugs mentioned by others (memory issue, occasional crashes), the only other issue is that the swipe isn't as intuitive as I'd prefer. A little too much effort is required to turn the page, so I don't read for as long as I'd want.
57a077015623ed07ff09d719;Bottom of the comics get compressed
57a077015623ed07ff09d71a;Frast Techniqe
57a077015623ed07ff09d71b;Scales down pages and makes them all pixellated
57a077045623ed07ff09d71c;Used to be good I'm facing some issues with this. I can't rotate the scenes to landscape view. It's stuck in portrait mode. There is also issue with the display. Some comics doesn't display properly. The bottom portion appear scrambled or even seems like a grey block.
57a077045623ed07ff09d71d;Awesome Easy to use.
57a077045623ed07ff09d71e;Buggy, poor performance consistently, even on flagship phones. No excuse for a comic viewer that can't view comics.
57a077045623ed07ff09d71f;Nice app, just an improvement to be perfect It's easy to display a read, but when opening the options its hard since new phones does not have that phone. I have to click back and most of times close the app.
57a077055623ed07ff09d720;Tired of reading half a comic. Keeps packing it in and lots of scrambled pictures.
57a077055623ed07ff09d721;Useless Can't handle CBR files. And they call themselves the most popular?
57a077055623ed07ff09d722;Great reader No bullshitting here.
57a077055623ed07ff09d723;SD Card Doesn't see the memory card where comics are stored so useless to me.
57a077055623ed07ff09d724;Works I downloaded a couple cbr comics and it works great. It would help if you could make your own collections of pictures.
57a077065623ed07ff09d725;Bah Bah boo bawhaaahaaaaa!! -YOURS TRULY KING BOB
57a077065623ed07ff09d726;Perfect. Been using for too many years to remember. Great for reading manga
57a077095623ed07ff09d727;.rar ? Won't open .rar files anymore plz fix
57a077095623ed07ff09d728;Usefull aplication for reading offline Comic I like to use it for reading my offline comic. Simply and good to use. Hope there is an option to turn off the' go to' function when I hold the page. Sometime it appear when I just want to pan the page. Keep the good work
57a077095623ed07ff09d729;Does what it's supposed to do
57a077095623ed07ff09d72a;rubbish nothing happens YOU ARE RUBBISH
57a0770c5623ed07ff09d72b;Problems at the bottom of the page Near the end of the page, the cbr page gets all glitchy and weird. I tried the same cbr document on an another viewer and it works perfectly, please fix.
57a0770c5623ed07ff09d72c;Doesn't work It tells to tap menu or logo to start. No menu button. When I press logo it has a bunch OV folders that are empty.
57a0770c5623ed07ff09d72d;Great.. Works perfectly.. But.. There was a problem opening one of my comics and it displayed an incomplete message something like "this often..." and some comics have some of their pages changed intp a damaged color screen but when I open the comic on PC, it's fine.
57a0770d5623ed07ff09d72e;Someone help me read comics in my memory before I delete this app
57a0770d5623ed07ff09d72f;ok
57a0770d5623ed07ff09d730;Used to work great and was easy to use. As of the last few weeks every page I open is distorted.
57a0770d5623ed07ff09d731;It just shuts down without any warning! I use Android lollipop and everytime I open up anything it would just close down instantly. If it fix this problem I probably pay for the premium version.

57a077115623ed07ff09d733;crashes on many .CBR files works with most older .cbz. needs to be fixed to handle cbr's
57a077115623ed07ff09d734;amazing i have been using this viewer for years. i am utterly impressed. however, the drain on the battery is the only thing that keeps me from using it often.
57a077115623ed07ff09d735;OK app but... Would be great if there was a library display that showed the covers.
57a077135623ed07ff09d736;No page select Options are go to&gt;next, previous, first, last. Trying to get to page 100 in a 200 page comic...
57a077135623ed07ff09d737;Images are low quality When I use other CBR readers the images come up much sharper, I've tested with several different comics, it's also very basic with no cover art or bookmarking
57a077135623ed07ff09d738;Faster then other comic readers. This was he first comic reader I used on android. Still the fastest reader, the others just dont offer the same performance as this one.
57a077175623ed07ff09d739;Out of memory Keeps showing that message and doesn't load past the first page. Downloaded it on my way out relying on it to entertain me on my 4 hour flight up ahead. Ended up staring at the back if someones seat with no comics to read
57a077175623ed07ff09d73a;Useless
57a077175623ed07ff09d73b;This app seems ok Its ok as it does the job.
57a077175623ed07ff09d73c;Its pretty good but i cant read my .cbr deadpool comic i extracted the file and it still wouldn't let me read it. please either fix this or help me...
57a077195623ed07ff09d73d;Almost perfect.. I rate this app 4.5.. if only there's option auto fit height or width image... I have some files with different image sizes.. Also there's annoying habit when I touch screen too long the app would zoom in.
57a077195623ed07ff09d73e;Needs change The icon for your app looks to much like a messaging app. Other then that its fine. Make change I will too, I'll give you the other star.
57a077195623ed07ff09d73f;Fix it... Upadet it... Exceto pelos erros de "mem√≥ria", um Update que resolva este problema seria genial. √â o melhor cbr no playstore. Para 5 estrelas falta s√≥ essa corre√ß√£o.
57a077195623ed07ff09d740;great its easy to used. .
57a0771a5623ed07ff09d741;How do I use this I'm new to all this I need to know step by step
57a0771a5623ed07ff09d742;Sucks Crashes to often says out of memory my phone has 96 gigs
57a0771a5623ed07ff09d743;It's a mess of an app. Nice attempt though.
57a0771a5623ed07ff09d744;Issues with CBR It doesn't display properly with corrupted lines on parts of the image and crashes a lot as other reviews say. CBR files work perfectly on my desktop
57a0771a5623ed07ff09d745;Awesome Really good app
57a0771c5623ed07ff09d746;Won't Zoom Enough The largest a page will get is the screen size of my galaxy s5. Kinda dumb.
57a0771c5623ed07ff09d747;Dose not read .CBR files Is terrible at reading files
57a0771c5623ed07ff09d748;Almost perfect It does precisely what it should do. Reading left to right and vice versa. Opening different types of extentions. However it will not open files when out of memory, especially if it contains over 200 files. Still good though. Samsung galaxy young*
57a0771c5623ed07ff09d749;Pure goodness
57a0771e5623ed07ff09d74a;Wonderful, Love it! Im reading the Civil War story with this. I heard you gotta pay for it, I dont mind cause this is great.
57a0771e5623ed07ff09d74b;Image crash I can open my comic but the picture is crash
57a0771e5623ed07ff09d74c;Always the best out of best....
57a0771e5623ed07ff09d74d;Not for manga Unfortunately I cannot set it up for a natural MANGA reading. My finger swipe direction (as in RTL reading) gives opposite visual feedback on the app's page turning. Maybe I will contribute to this open source project or just fork it as my own.
57a077205623ed07ff09d74e;It is good when it works Low memory issues... Don't give me that crap... I have like 2gigs of free RAM ... Fix that and I will give 5
57a077235623ed07ff09d74f;Good app, thank you. It will be great if it can open next folder automatically, and improve zoom in control.
57a077235623ed07ff09d750;Funciona Muy bien encima es gratis genial aplicacion
57a077235623ed07ff09d751;Not sure if new version is broken since this is my first te trying, but I tested 3 completely different series CBR's, and all 3 take 30-45 seconds to load the next page after tapping to turn page. Often times it doesn't work at all on a Note 4. Removing in favor of other apps that work, sorry.
57a077265623ed07ff09d752;Works well enough, but it doesn't seem able to launch CBR files from device; rather, it requires launching comics from google drive or dropbox. Other than this, the controls are a bit unresponsive.
57a077265623ed07ff09d753;Good reader
57a077265623ed07ff09d754;Can't load pages properly
57a077265623ed07ff09d755;It works for the most part There were a few of my CBR files where it would start garbling the pages and then occasionally crash with an out of memory error. I sent in the reports but have moved to another reader that works much better.
57a077285623ed07ff09d756;sucks ComicRack does a better, far better job. It doesn't even add comics to its database üòë . And the viewer doesn't work too. Pages come all crappy.
57a077285623ed07ff09d757;Good apps! So far i'm using it, no problem at all. But needs improvement. I suggest to add bookmarks, it's good for multiple user. And please add library instead of reading history. It would be better! :)
57a077285623ed07ff09d758;Glitches make comics unreadable I tried to open 2 comics and both had lots of static at the bottom of the comics. I thought it might be the comics but I then opened the comics with perfect viewer and they looked just fine. If this glitch wasn't their it would be good but it just looks terrible and ruins the comic.
57a0772b5623ed07ff09d759;Help me!! For some reason, my comic files work fine on pc, even when viewing from SD i have them on, but in app, they "glitch" out, some areas grey, others weird. makes some pages unreadable. Cannot find a website or any way to contact support, 1star til then!
57a0772b5623ed07ff09d75a;Bad very bad.... Don't open correctly CDR files than others open well
57a0772b5623ed07ff09d75b;Poor quality The quality is really poor when reading mangas on a big screen like the nexus 9. The same material looks great in other viewers.
57a0772e5623ed07ff09d75c;It reads my files, but... It seems to not allow the pages to rotate when I turn my phone. The particular files I have contain facing pages, not just single pages, so landscape is a better layout which, at least with my note 3, this app doesn't support.
57a0772e5623ed07ff09d75d;It's good It's very good
57a0772e5623ed07ff09d75e;Won't import Hadn't used it in awhile. Opened it, and there's no folder icon at the top to load new comics.
57a0772e5623ed07ff09d75f;Comics that view fine in other viewers are corrupted in ACV Multiple comic files I have do not decode properly in ACV but are fine in other viewers.
57a077305623ed07ff09d760;Love this Really help me to read manga..
57a077305623ed07ff09d761;Went from great to horrible This used to be a top notch viewer bbut recently it has become unusable with no fix in sight. Hopefully, it will be fixed, until then I'll be using another. Also, I cannot uninstall it. Keep selecting 'uninstall' but nothing happens.
57a077305623ed07ff09d762;Awesome! It's easy to use, loads fast & works great! It lacks a library feature but that's fine....
57a077305623ed07ff09d763;Distorted images
57a077305623ed07ff09d764;Couldn't view my comics but other apps worked
57a077325623ed07ff09d765;Deadpool I've read every appearance thanks to this app.
57a077325623ed07ff09d766;Can't comment Until I use it again
57a077325623ed07ff09d767;NotSoBad Works well for me for the most part. Had some issues opening a few files but still worth it.
57a077325623ed07ff09d768;The pages were always jacked up on the bottom half.
57a077325623ed07ff09d769;Every second page is that "ooops cannt open file", cant read comics at all. Fix that issue and i 5star u.
57a077355623ed07ff09d76a;Used to work Worked perfectly on my galaxy s4 but a third of the comic page not visible now with galaxy S5 Active
57a077355623ed07ff09d76b;nothing special better than other comic reader app i have come across, reads all comic files but once you start reading theres no option for to go to root menu or open files. Would have been great if there was.
57a077355623ed07ff09d76c;It's simple and great! Except... Cbr files for some reason are impossible for this app to run. It's an incredibly frustrating thing. So, I've got to use a seperate app to open cbr. Can this please be fixed?
57a077355623ed07ff09d76d;Nice and simple :)
57a077365623ed07ff09d76e;Superb app
57a077365623ed07ff09d76f;Glitches pages
57a077365623ed07ff09d770;Worst
57a077365623ed07ff09d771;This is IT
57a077365623ed07ff09d772;Pretty good app, hasn't crashed for me once!
57a077365623ed07ff09d773;Crashes all the time
57a077375623ed07ff09d774;Good app for comic
57a077375623ed07ff09d775;Always out of memory
57a077375623ed07ff09d776;works sparsely sometimes works fine, sometimes cant open certain pages of my comics, sometimes won't open the comic at all. other app had no problems..
57a0773e5623ed07ff09d777;Have problems Some cbr don't open
57a0773e5623ed07ff09d778;Wont open files Keep tryinh to read comics on it and this DAM MESSAGE KEEPS COMING UP 'Oops can't open file may be due to low memory try closing acv and opening it after a while' I HAVE 2GIGS AND I CLOSED ACV FOR THREE WEEKS AND IT WOULDN'T OPEN FIX THIS ~SAMSUNG Galaxy S2
57a0773e5623ed07ff09d779;Awesome. But the scrolling down section could be marginally increase
57a0773e5623ed07ff09d77a;Steady eddy Got job done starts to crash lately though..
57a0773f5623ed07ff09d77b;Great app
57a0773f5623ed07ff09d77c;Awesome Very good light app
57a0773f5623ed07ff09d77d;The best comic reader app around. Its simple and precise .
57a0773f5623ed07ff09d77e;Excellent CBR reader Works fine for me
57a0773f5623ed07ff09d77f;Yeah marvelous Wenderfull
57a077415623ed07ff09d780;Nexus 10 Once this was the best, now I'm having more and more problems... Half images/missing pages. Switching to PV!!
57a077415623ed07ff09d781;Does the job Seems there are complaints around CBR, but those seem to miss the fact that the CBR format requires the entire file to be unpacked in memory. Switching to a more sensible format, e.g. CBZ, does the job fine. All in all it does what I need it to, with few or no issues.
57a077415623ed07ff09d782;broken for cbr file..!! It works fine to view any images but for comics...just NO!! 2/5 star
57a077415623ed07ff09d783;Nasty Tried to view futures end on this reader and it messed up the visuals. There were lines all across it. Downloaded a different one and they showed fine. Don't use this one
57a077435623ed07ff09d784;Very annoying Occasionally I get an oops out of error message. I follow the instructions and it doesn't work. So I read something else and its fine.
57a077435623ed07ff09d785;Now has pinch-to-zoom! Excellent app! Droid.
57a077435623ed07ff09d786;I love it! It has kwaai stories.. I just love it, I can't even explain it.
57a077435623ed07ff09d787;Glitched panels Otherwise great
57a077435623ed07ff09d788;The best I was able to find so far.
57a077465623ed07ff09d789;Suitable for me This application is very easy to use and can support my comic file
57a077465623ed07ff09d78a;Pages look corrupt.
57a077465623ed07ff09d78b;a comic viewer Too many adds, but if you need Cdisplay to read your comics, download, 'a comic viewer ' I can now read all my Conan & Red Sonja comics on android tablet. Thankyouverymuch.
57a077465623ed07ff09d78c;Light n simple
57a077485623ed07ff09d78d;Ehhh An app that tries to let you read comics on mobil but suffers a lot of memory issues and crash errors. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And when it doesn't it's usually in the middle of a comic. Frustrating
57a077485623ed07ff09d78e;Barely works When it works properly, it's great; unfortunately, that seems to be a rarity. Most of the time I get "unable to load image" errors - on a tablet with 2 GB of memory... A comic book reader that won't actually let you read comics is kind of useless...
57a077485623ed07ff09d78f;Simple and super-awesome!!
57a0774a5623ed07ff09d790;I love this app! Is really simple and functional, you can't go wrong with it. If you are looking for a lightweight app for you cbr and cbz comics don't look further this ifs the app to get
57a0774a5623ed07ff09d791;Always ran out of memory This app sucks. Dont download this one
57a0774a5623ed07ff09d792;Great app Very useful 4 reading comic books.,,luv it
57a0774a5623ed07ff09d793;Broken Every page that it shows are half broken and are unable read
57a0774d5623ed07ff09d794;Great app, except for with CBR On most CBR files, it'll throw an error about being out of memory. Doesn't matter if you're on a device with 512mb, or 2gb of RAM, and will always do it on the same pages. Open it up in another reader, on the same device, zero problems. Long time user, but this has just got to be too much.
57a0774d5623ed07ff09d795;half of the screen is messed up plus takes so much time to move from one page to next...
57a0774d5623ed07ff09d796;This app have a good quality
57a0774d5623ed07ff09d797;This app gives me problem with opening .cbr files. I thought at first it was because of the files are corrupted but when I download a different comic viewer it works just fine.
57a0774f5623ed07ff09d798;Doesn't work on cbr files CBR is supposedly supported, it is nog working right though. It always crashes on cbr comics on my galaxy tablet (2) and seldom works on my Galaxy S4. No updates to fix this.
57a0774f5623ed07ff09d799;Good app, needs better file search Very good app, would like a better way to search for files to add.
57a0774f5623ed07ff09d79a;FC in every book after a few pages
57a0774f5623ed07ff09d79b;Not good Switching to another reader.
57a077555623ed07ff09d79c;Open source, Ads, Site points to spam I "installed" just so I can say this, the domain points to those fake search sites and just returns spam/junk and attempts to install fake versions of Flash. My trust from this company is gone, but I have no issues sifting through the source-code to compile and install locally.
57a077555623ed07ff09d79d;Ugly Had problems with comics others read.
57a077555623ed07ff09d79e;I highly recommend it Very great app to view your comics/books/etc data
57a077575623ed07ff09d79f;Use to be my favorite Cbr files! I go between three different readers. Perfect Viewer, Comics Reader and ACV. ACV has the best layout but doesn't play all my files!
57a077575623ed07ff09d7a0;Image files &gt; 2MB are not loaded properly and the app crashes, I've switched to another reader. Too bad this one is great with my archos gamepad 2.
57a077575623ed07ff09d7a1;Best!!!!! It is a very app as I can read cbz and cbr files through it and it help me alot.
57a077575623ed07ff09d7a2;Okay at best Crashes after 3-4 pages
57a0775a5623ed07ff09d7a3;Cbr and cbz fail Fail on opening pages but comicrack works.
57a0775a5623ed07ff09d7a4;Out of memory error Unusable
57a0775a5623ed07ff09d7a5;This comic viewer is different to many others... It works!!! 5 stars...
57a0775a5623ed07ff09d7a6;Excellent in every regard except... This is an excellent app and I couldn't be happier. I have also tried Komik, but noticed that the images are blurry when scrolling and takes a second for it to sharpen. ACV does not have this problem! One feature that this app desperately needs, however, is full screen support (which Komik has). Please add full screen support for those running Kit Kat and this will be the perfect comic reader :D
57a0775c5623ed07ff09d7a7;Awesome Best one I tried
57a0775c5623ed07ff09d7a8;Very good, i always use it when reading comics
57a0775c5623ed07ff09d7a9;It Perfect. Sometimes the comics are a little messed up.
57a0775c5623ed07ff09d7aa;Best comic book viewer Opens all comics just like CDisplay.
57a0775c5623ed07ff09d7ab;Decent if you don't like to read You can look at pictures but forget getting understanding what's going on because he bottom of every page is garbage.
57a0775f5623ed07ff09d7ac;The idea is nice but the actual app needs some work. Was flipping through a comic last night and only reached page 100 when it complained about running out of memory. It told me to either unpack the archive or close the app and run it later. Why even bother with a cbz viewer if you have to unpack it all to view it? I'd just use the gallery on my phone and flip through pictures.
57a0775f5623ed07ff09d7ad;Wonderful App The swipe to change pages and the buttons to change pages do not always work the first or second attempts but they do eventually. Other than that, this is a wonderful app. I did have to convert some CBR/CBZ files into ZIP after some memory errors but that was quick and easy. I have tried some other comic apps. This one is the greatest by far.
57a077615623ed07ff09d7ae;Great Great for comics, controls really customisable
57a077615623ed07ff09d7af;Nice app i can't set my whatsapp d.p...bt now i change my d.p wid this app
57a077615623ed07ff09d7b0;Best like it best app to view .rar file and best for comic reading.
57a077615623ed07ff09d7b1;There Better readers If its a comic reader why not make it read square to square? Reads just the same as any other "reader app" out there.
57a077615623ed07ff09d7b2;Below average As it does not support a bunch of comics.
57a077655623ed07ff09d7b3;Awesome Nice
57a077655623ed07ff09d7b4;Stopped loading pages The controls are slightly unituitive, the zoom doesnt work very well at all and after using for several days it wouldn't load my images anymore due to some weird error that I tried in vain to resolve and that would randomly reappear at the most inconvenient times.
57a077655623ed07ff09d7b5;Use to work but crashes now Doesn't do good on cbr files at all. Sometimes it will fully work but some pages won't load
57a077655623ed07ff09d7b6;Easy to use Great app
57a077685623ed07ff09d7b7;Meh.. Opens the file and scrolls a couple pages then crashes. I cleared my ram. Same problem.
57a077685623ed07ff09d7b8;great the best android comic reader
57a077685623ed07ff09d7b9;Love the format, hate the stability As I said, great format and user controls. But almost every other page of any comic I get either a memory error or a corrupted data error. Fix that or this app is useless. I like the features just wish I could actually read through an entire comic with out some BS. Will be switching to a different app and uninstalling this until it is made useable.
57a077685623ed07ff09d7ba;Please update it Sometimes it shows error when I open next page... Please update it and fix errors. ... Otherwise it's 4 star app...
57a0776a5623ed07ff09d7bb;WOW.. Very nice!
57a0776a5623ed07ff09d7bc;awesome this app is just great... reads .cbr files just fine, but the zooming is really tedious...
57a0776a5623ed07ff09d7bd;Good comic reader Can be a bit slow rendering pages but still the best out there
57a0776a5623ed07ff09d7be;Cbr problems Cbr isn't working too good
57a0776a5623ed07ff09d7bf;Potential But sadly it hasn't gotten there yet, maybe someday it will but for now, it's only got potential
57a0776d5623ed07ff09d7c0;Worked now out of memory error Out of memory sucks use to work good found that this app "Simple Comic Viewer" working for me loading comics no errors.
57a0776d5623ed07ff09d7c1;Too awesome Very simple, can read all my comics and manga here
57a0776d5623ed07ff09d7c2;ICS Problem Can't open settings on ICS.
57a0776d5623ed07ff09d7c3;Needs updating This app works great on my older phone, but now that I've upgraded most of my files are no longer appearing correctly.
57a077715623ed07ff09d7c4;Slow on tablets In need of a major update. Images not as crisp or bright as on jjComic Viewer or Perfect Viewer.
57a077715623ed07ff09d7c5;Great
57a077715623ed07ff09d7c6;Error codes Won't load pages of certain books. Asks me to unzip files that are not zipped.
57a077745623ed07ff09d7c7;Loving it Thanks for the comic sliz
57a077745623ed07ff09d7c8;Exellent Ever good app
57a077745623ed07ff09d7c9;Good comic reader
57a077745623ed07ff09d7ca;Great No complaints. Brill app.
57a077745623ed07ff09d7cb;Keeps crashing on cbr files Close to giving up on this app...it keeps failing to load multiple pages in cbr files, running out of memory or something. When its the first page that can't load, there doesn't seem to be a way of loading _any_ pages.
57a077775623ed07ff09d7cc;Served me well I used this app a lot for offline reading, easy to use and simple zoom controls. Used it on a S3 and a nameless copycat tablet. Also I like the current app icon, simple and no text. But, now I'm looking for a change, this app now feels outdated... I hope this app will rise again someday. >SFMBE
57a077775623ed07ff09d7cd;Vr g Hay
57a077775623ed07ff09d7ce;Can't open some comics. So I had to change to another app in order for me to read a comic. Because this app kept on saying that they couldn't open because of error, but after I changed to this other app there was no problem at all. So I'm sad about this as I used to like this app a lot.
57a077775623ed07ff09d7cf;Works Great
57a077795623ed07ff09d7d0;Page turning sucks Like the title says, you can't turn pages smoothly at all. The comics load nice, but the page turning is hell
57a077795623ed07ff09d7d1;It's hanging too frequently, even I have a descent tablet
57a077795623ed07ff09d7d2;Perfect Nothing to report. Does what it should and does it well
57a077795623ed07ff09d7d3;Awesome Awesome
57a077795623ed07ff09d7d4;Best app to view comic. Nice app!
57a0777b5623ed07ff09d7d5;Not supporting my cbr files. What the subject line says.
57a0777b5623ed07ff09d7d6;Good for the price It is fast but there's a lot of memory issues especially when trying to read a large comic book with over a hundred pages
57a0777b5623ed07ff09d7d7;Best Ive found For my tab 2 10.1
57a0777b5623ed07ff09d7d8;Cool Good
57a0777b5623ed07ff09d7d9;Simple clean Best .cbr format reader
57a0777c5623ed07ff09d7da;Good An awesome comic reader
57a0777c5623ed07ff09d7db;Almost perfect! Needs Korean, long length comic support.
57a0777c5623ed07ff09d7dc;Works as advertised
57a0777c5623ed07ff09d7dd;Dark Good app
57a0777c5623ed07ff09d7de;Still no CBR support I've had bugs with other archives as well. For an open-source project with IAP, you'd think one of the major formats would have been developed by now. Every other reader I've tested supports them.
57a0777e5623ed07ff09d7df;Sucks
57a0777e5623ed07ff09d7e0;Very nice viewer that needs some work... Light and effective, very simple to use. It seems to have some bugs under Jelly Bean... like the vanished menu top. Never the less a solid and fast reader.
57a0777e5623ed07ff09d7e1;Thanks Reads my comics! Perfect!
57a0777e5623ed07ff09d7e2;What the hell! Why is there no PDF support? That's pretty ridiculous.
57a0777e5623ed07ff09d7e3;No updates No updates ? Please update for full immersion mode on android 4.4 kit kat.
57a077825623ed07ff09d7e4;Excellent Ôºà*'‚àÄ'‰∫∫Ôºâ‚ô•*+ good aplication. Easy to use it.
57a077825623ed07ff09d7e5;Great CBR reader Just kinda klunky trying to find, say, the next chapter and digging through file folders.
57a077825623ed07ff09d7e6;works great have had no problems with it.
57a077825623ed07ff09d7e7;Good app I really like this app, I just wish we would get an update that marks the issues of a comic series I have read so I know where I left off last, especially in a series with a lot of issues.
57a077825623ed07ff09d7e8;Way better than moon+ reader
57a077845623ed07ff09d7e9;Needs lot of work Crashes a lot reading cbr files. Works better after cbr is extracted as a jpeg viewer. Always crashing. MoonReader is better, it never crashed on low end tablet or phone viewing cbr or cbz.
57a077845623ed07ff09d7ea;Great
57a077845623ed07ff09d7eb;Crash Constantly crashes my record is 2 whole read pages without a crash. Its a shame as when I used to use this app (older version) there was no problems
57a077845623ed07ff09d7ec;The best !!!
57a0778a5623ed07ff09d7ed;Galaxy S4-Good for a while, stops working Really great reader, but after my third or fourth comic everything becomes fuzzy halfway through each page. Please fix that. Otherwise it's great.
57a0778a5623ed07ff09d7ee;Out of memory It used to work great, but now it runs out of memory when opening larger (10 meg+ files). Other comic readers open the comics fine. Also for ICS, it should remove the bottom bar when in full screen mode.
57a0778d5623ed07ff09d7ef;Good but now its not working So when I first got this app it was great but then it started having crashes and it wouldn't let me flip the page please reply
57a0778d5623ed07ff09d7f0;Great viewer A few hiccups when it comes to .rar files, but works great 98% of the time
57a0778d5623ed07ff09d7f1;Rubbish This is the most boring game and when it finally worked it was soooo boring
57a0778d5623ed07ff09d7f2;Good. But there is room for improvement. Encountered weird problems while viewing my comic. Half the page would be blitzed out and nearly unable to read. It happens from time to time. When I read the comic on my computer, I can read it just fine. There may be a glitch in the system. May wanna check it out. Thanks.
57a0778f5623ed07ff09d7f3;Nice little app 5/5
57a0778f5623ed07ff09d7f4;Good idea lots of errors Keeps giving me memory issues on the nexus 7 not terribly impressed. Images constantly rescaled despite setting it not to.
57a0778f5623ed07ff09d7f5;Simple and fast Has the most intuitive controls and options for custom settings :-)
57a0778f5623ed07ff09d7f6;Love it
57a0778f5623ed07ff09d7f7;bad ui design ....
57a077935623ed07ff09d7f8;Uinstalled Every comic I try to read I get an out of memory error about 3 pages in. This app is a joke.
57a077935623ed07ff09d7f9;Unable to load image Hi i get the error unable to load image This generally happens because of a memory error im using galaxy s3 and i cleared all tasks in tm but this still happens what can i do?
57a077935623ed07ff09d7fa;Awesome comic reader Only issue is out of memory problems on the odd page... Annoying but not fatal. Other than that, small fast and effective. Thank you. FTR: I am running ur app on my stock Nexus 7.
57a077985623ed07ff09d7fb;Great when it works... ...but persistent memory (or otherwise undetermined) issues make it a perpetual frustration to use. Even with a ton of free RAM and a file that opens in everything else without issue, it's a coin toss whether I can go five pages without a crash in ACV. Nothing seems to be a permanent fix.
57a077985623ed07ff09d7fc;Great app But I'm getting an out of memory error, how do I fix this?
57a077985623ed07ff09d7fd;Best thing ever! Awesome app
57a077985623ed07ff09d7fe;Not good at all. Literally crashes all the time after viewing 10-12 pages of a comic book. And I have like 500 MB of memory free on the tablet.
57a0779b5623ed07ff09d7ff;About 2/3 of my books did not work. Comicrack works better.
57a0779b5623ed07ff09d800;Good, needs some improvement Crashes a lot. But easy to use.
57a0779b5623ed07ff09d801;Won't load any files I have 2GB of memory on this tablet and it's repeatedly telling me that I don't have enough memory to load a 30 MB file. Moon reader has no issues doing just that.
57a0779b5623ed07ff09d802;awesome program. Perfect.
57a0779b5623ed07ff09d803;How do i download comics?
57a0779e5623ed07ff09d804;Awesome Light & easy.will Give 5 star but page not open in some cbr files.
57a0779e5623ed07ff09d805;Feeling childhood.... ahhh Amazing continusly reading doga comics only from this app ... i love it... and thanxxxx again for this app
57a0779e5623ed07ff09d806;Useful I like this program, because it doesn't make any troubles or errors, and it's very easy to use, but I wish if they add a library to make it more easily.
57a0779e5623ed07ff09d807;Pretty good! Works just how I expect it to! I love lightweight, effective apps!
57a077a25623ed07ff09d808;Nkg Coooll
57a077a25623ed07ff09d809;Decent Reader Most of my comics worked well in this app, but there were a few that would open and show lines all over the place and cut off pages in random spots. I thought it was the files because some of the comics were fine, but the corrupted comics opened fine in another comic book viewer app.
57a077a25623ed07ff09d80a;Up to my demanding album I often keep large hi-resolution images stored. This viewer handles them fine, without breaking a sweat. The option to manually turn off screen rotation in the viewer, without affecting other apps, is also a nice touch. If only you could view thumbnail previews as well.
57a077a55623ed07ff09d80b;Works great.. when it works It seems to have trouble handling most of the compressed cbr or cbz files, and it frequently asks for the files to be decompressed into a directory so it can read them. Once the files are extracted, it works like a charm and is really easy to use, but it's an annoyance that the file most be almost always extracted.
57a077a55623ed07ff09d80c;Nice Awesome graphics display & book navigation. Seems completely bug-free: a rare gem. Wish it had landscape option.
57a077a55623ed07ff09d80d;No menu Will not open at all on Droid razor Max. There is not a menu to open. Shame to I was hoping for bloom county. Uninstall
57a077a85623ed07ff09d80e;Crashy and Buggy Most comics I try to read on this app either don't work at all or are extremely glitchy. Give this one a miss.
57a077a85623ed07ff09d80f;Would be great if..... it actually worked. Its not that it force closes its that it just doesnt work about half way in. I got through maybe 4 pages and it trys tl load the next page but it will not at all. I have tried to reopen and restart and it stays stuck on thd 4th page. 1 star until it is fixed. If I could actuakky get through a whole comic I'd consider it to be a great app.
57a077a85623ed07ff09d810;Decent comic viewer,it works at least
57a077a85623ed07ff09d811;Worst comic reader ever! I can't read my new 52 comics and to many bugs!
57a077aa5623ed07ff09d812;Failed Could not load the first file I tried on it
57a077aa5623ed07ff09d813;IT STINKS! It can't read .cbr files very well. It shows images as being corrupted. When viewed by other comic applications the same files are perfectly fine.
57a077aa5623ed07ff09d814;Excellent comic reader Really enjoying comic books right now thanks to this easy to use reader.
57a077aa5623ed07ff09d815;Works great Does exactly what I wanted it to do. Allowed me to read my CBR files.
57a077b25623ed07ff09d816;Heavily gesture driven In order to use this software, you will have to look in the custom controls to learn what gestures mean what and be able to make these gestures (and not make these gestures) dependably. A few extra ghost controls for things like bringing up the menu would have been nice.
57a077b55623ed07ff09d817;Can't recommend it, sorry Haven't been able to open one file with an out of memory error, either from main memory or SD card, these are files that perfect viewer has no problem with. Nook HD+ rooted with cyanogen
57a077b55623ed07ff09d818;Its good Its good
57a077b55623ed07ff09d819;Great!!! Works like a charm. Easy to use, needs only a little space. Thank you!
57a077b55623ed07ff09d81a;AWESOME The interface is just amazing! You guys could make a similar app for PDF files, if you think about it. It'd be great if you guys got around to doing that.
57a077b85623ed07ff09d81b;Almost awesome This app has so much potential, easy to use and navigate. It just has a lot of bugs. Won't load images or they load messed up. In the end I had to go with a different viewer
57a077b85623ed07ff09d81c;CBR bugs. A decent app but I've already had two CBRs crash on me. Extracting them works, but I shouldn't have to extract every comic just so they don't bug out and close.
57a077b85623ed07ff09d81d;I have a new nexus tablet and paid for the no ads version of this app. It only views about 20% of comics I attempt to open. Do not waste precious memory on this defective app. Use perfect viewer, it is appropriately named and has yet to give me a memory error. You have been warned.
57a077ba5623ed07ff09d81e;Idk. It worked fine on my Evo but on this phone... nope wont even open. Sad I really liked the app. I guess its time to find a new one :-\
57a077ba5623ed07ff09d81f;Get it I got it for my note 2 it's awesome and I love it!
57a077ba5623ed07ff09d820;Not the best comic app Blurry text, colors not as vibrant, page turns are slow, and the reading flow is not very intuitive
57a077ba5623ed07ff09d821;Old outdated Confusing and has not been updated in over a year. There are better apps than this one.
57a077bc5623ed07ff09d822;Best I don't usually speak in superlatives but this app is great and it gets the job done.
57a077bc5623ed07ff09d823;Not bad...
57a077bc5623ed07ff09d824;Ugly Unstable, slow, terrible image quality.
57a077bc5623ed07ff09d825;wonderful Five stars with bookmark function.
57a077bc5623ed07ff09d826;Worst Doesn't even detect large files
57a077bf5623ed07ff09d827;One of the best! I've tried several apps to read comics and so far this one is the simplest yet also the best comic reader I've used. Will use this until God knows when
57a077bf5623ed07ff09d828;Its alright I didn't really like that I couldn't zoom in farther than the comics fit too screen
57a077bf5623ed07ff09d829;Still buggy App is buggy, keeps crashing. I dont have time to convert all my cbr into cbz or whatever. Just use Perfect Viewer, much better Android comic reader.
57a077bf5623ed07ff09d82a;Poor Quality Scaling Makes everything look fuzzy when trying to use any of the scaling modes. Other readers display the same comic file perfectly when scaled. Nice app but unfortunately makes my comics unreadable.
57a077c75623ed07ff09d82b;Scaling is wack How am I suppose to read my comic with such limited zooming!
57a077c75623ed07ff09d82c;Bad Runs out of memory on my way phone which is an S4
57a077c75623ed07ff09d82d;Constant out of momory crashes In portrait or landscape mode reading trade paperback .cbr's causes constant crashes of files that when used on my computer read just fine. This is REALLY too bad, as it is a nice interface. Maybe it is just the size of some of these trade paperbacks that throws the app as smaller 45-60 page cbr's work, but if that was the case then using low memory mode would have had a positive effect (it hasn't). Another annoyance (though easily remedied) was the swipe menu. I'm giving 3 out of 5 stars in hope that they sort the crashing out on the free version...that might even convince me to buy the premium version (hint, hint).
57a077ca5623ed07ff09d82e;Nope Doesn't open/read CBR files. What's the point?
57a077ca5623ed07ff09d82f;Decent Reader, Not for Archives It usually runs out of memory when it comes to archives in general. If it does open the archive, then there is a chance for corrupted images full of artifacts. The back button doesn't behave like it does in other apps, causing mistaken exits highly likely. In the file manager, make it go up a level. In the comic viewer, make it, by default, go back a page or exit the comic, but stay within the app.
57a077ca5623ed07ff09d830;Just not easy to use. I like the Komik viewer better
57a077ca5623ed07ff09d831;Good Some bugs in opening some files but generally the best comic reader I've seen.
57a077cc5623ed07ff09d832;Error straight from the start. RAR out of memory error on Nexus 4. Restarted as instructed. No effect. App sent into the future from year 1994.
57a077cc5623ed07ff09d833;Great viewer.
57a077cc5623ed07ff09d834;Perfect viewer is better This app is boo boo
57a077cc5623ed07ff09d835;Problems Its very good for comics. But sometimes unable to open certain pages... it became so irritating. It'd be awesome if that problem could be fixed...
57a077cc5623ed07ff09d836;Good Nice one
57a077cf5623ed07ff09d837;Low res when try to zoom in
57a077cf5623ed07ff09d838;Bug!! I thought you've "fixed bug that prevented opening comic files with ACV...." Apparently, not. After the 5th page of the comic I'm reading, it suddenly stopped there. Really uninstalling, just go back to moonreader.
57a077cf5623ed07ff09d839;Help It wont open for me
57a077cf5623ed07ff09d83a;Not bad but crashes far too much Using it on my droid x, s3, note 2, xoom, and nexus 10. Crashes a lot when reading comics. Perfect viewer works flawlessly
57a077d85623ed07ff09d83b;Never got to know it for real I had some CBR files, which it didn't open. I know, the developer states that CBR files are still in beta, so no problem really, but I had to search for another app and I uninstalled this one. Sorry...
57a077d85623ed07ff09d83c;Some pages Some pages tend to not load and close the program. The only problem.
57a077d85623ed07ff09d83d;This app needs updating. Doesn't retain custom zoom, doesn't auto open next folder, slow transition,
57a077d85623ed07ff09d83e;Good, but buggy on Nexus 7 It's work pretty well most of the time. It's just very buggy on my Nexus 7. Crashes a lot, image fitting options don't seem to work right, lot's of sporadic lag.
57a077db5623ed07ff09d83f;Near constant memory error messages The presentation is slick, clean and simple. It is a shame that it can rarely get through a whole comic without crashing. I tried 3 comic reader apps to see which one was best, and this would have been my favorite, if only it functioned. As it is, I am uninstalling this and going with Comicrack. Neither of the other apps I tried had the crippling issues this one does.
57a077db5623ed07ff09d840;Good Working
57a077db5623ed07ff09d841;Sucks I can't load the comics
57a077db5623ed07ff09d842;Nice :-)
57a077dc5623ed07ff09d843;Functions as intended!
57a077dc5623ed07ff09d844;Could be worst It should be able 2 read every zip type file without having 2 unzip it.
57a077dc5623ed07ff09d845;Are you kidding? This app does not work!! Installed, launch, then nothing. Doesn't download comics or anything. This is useless.
57a077dc5623ed07ff09d846;Fantastic Not much to be said. Best comic reader for Android
57a077dc5623ed07ff09d847;Great
57a077df5623ed07ff09d848;Nice app
57a077df5623ed07ff09d849;Awesome Great app lil bug problem bout loading a certain file but f ing awesome
57a077df5623ed07ff09d84a;Great App!
57a077df5623ed07ff09d84b;It doesnt work It doesnt work I cant open my cbr files
57a077df5623ed07ff09d84c;Poor Cant view files beyond 2nd page.
57a077e15623ed07ff09d84d;Awesome ! Perfect for those who wanna read comics in their android mobiles
57a077e15623ed07ff09d84e;Sucktastic No memory error every time
57a077e15623ed07ff09d84f;TERRIBLE app U can't even read comics on here! If u could put zero stars I would
57a077e15623ed07ff09d850;CBR/CBZ buggy Cant open CBR or CBZ files on my S4. Thats the reason i downloaded this app so ive now deleted it...
57a077e55623ed07ff09d851;Out of memory? I keep getting error messages when I turn a page. "this is generally caused by an out of memory error." out of memory on devices with 1 and 2gb ram? Couldn't be, I can read them all backwards without an error. This app would be great except for a single debilitating fault.
57a077e55623ed07ff09d852;FC on my very first comic Tried opening CBR file (the reason i downloaded this apps in the first place) only to see if Force close after about 15 seconds -- Still on the first page. Some memory error thingy and asking me to try again shortly. Tried again 1 minute later and still the same. Saw the apps description say BETA for CBR? Hmmm... Not really impressed with this apps. Installed Moon+ to try out. No crash. So... Bye.
57a077e85623ed07ff09d853;Memory bugs This is an awesome, user friendly app... When it works. Memory bugs cripple certain files I've used on other apps and devices successfully. Fix it and I'll give more stars.
57a077e85623ed07ff09d854;Really good Really smooth!
57a077e85623ed07ff09d855;5 star Does what it says, does it well and free.
57a077e85623ed07ff09d856;Nowt No comics, just a file folder, I'm confused.
57a077e85623ed07ff09d857;Good app It's a good and simple app but not the best I've used. When it isn't able to read a comic you're sol.
57a077ec5623ed07ff09d858;A lot simpler and cleaner This comic book series a lot simpler and easier to read your comics with. The interface is more out of the way, and it's not ridiculously complicated to use like some other comic viewer programs.
57a077ec5623ed07ff09d859;Galaxy Tab 10.1 Hangs when opening a file
57a077ec5623ed07ff09d85a;Bad Won't let me open some pages from the comics and just shuts down.
57a077ec5623ed07ff09d85b;Annoying issue I purchased the pro version through the app, and ever since I've been receiving a recurring notification stating that the purchase has failed. Please edit or change the protocol for handling and verifying purchases.
57a077f25623ed07ff09d85c;Crap. Never opens any CBR file without a pop up that goes 'lack of memory' or anything else at least once.
57a077f25623ed07ff09d85d;Ok, but has problems It's fine for viewing comics, although controls aren't the most intuitive and gestures easy to get straight. If it didn't crash quite often with CBR files, I wouldn't mind the rest, but it gets annoying - today, I had 3 comics on my phone, it crashed on the 3rd page of 2 of them.
57a077f25623ed07ff09d85e;Works great when it works. It crashes every now and then but besides that it works perfectly. It has everything you could ever ask for from a comic reader.
57a077f25623ed07ff09d85f;Sucks Freezes at every other slide.
57a077f55623ed07ff09d860;Annoying Great set-up if it worked but you can't get anywhere without oops error : Out of memory message. This sucks!
57a077f55623ed07ff09d861;Great app So easy to read CBR files here
57a077f55623ed07ff09d862;Overall fairly good Recent changes have improved quality greatly. Took me a bit to figure out how to get the menu up and modify the settings. Now that I have it set to my preferences it serves my needs perfectly. Many CBR files have issues in this app, yet work in all other apps.
57a077f55623ed07ff09d863;Not for me Memory crash.
57a077ff5623ed07ff09d864;Same problem as others, low memory bulls#!+. This app dosent even work what a joke this is. I like to uninstall crap like this and leave thrutfull feedback. Dont waste your time people!
57a077ff5623ed07ff09d865;Not bad but frustrating Used this app for a while but keep getting "unable to load" error messages. I'm switching to perfect viewer
57a077ff5623ed07ff09d866;Great Work perfectly
57a078025623ed07ff09d867;Nice app Could improve memory issues though. Uninstalling, Comic Rack is better.
57a078025623ed07ff09d868;not bad not bad on samsung nexus s, but frequent out of memory.....
57a078025623ed07ff09d869;Bad Crashes all the time.
57a078025623ed07ff09d86a;Do not download for CBR Downloaded onto my Galaxy S3 w/ jelly bean to read CBR files. Constantly gives error message stating no memory left to display file. I now use Comic Rack free. No issues.
57a078065623ed07ff09d86b;Poor Worked fine on Nexus 7 for a few days, then started crashing at every start up due to a memory error whereas other readers still work fine.
57a078065623ed07ff09d86c;Great comic app Downloaded this app on a whim and I recomend it to anyone that wants to read comics. Fast start up. Limited adds that I can stand. Great app all around.
57a078065623ed07ff09d86d;Garbage If it could do anything but crash I'd have given it at least 3 stars, but no, all it does is crash. Perfect Viewer is FAR more stable and better all around.
57a078095623ed07ff09d86e;Love this app... I really love this app, I only wish the interface was better. It would be perfect if it gave you the front covers of the Comics, much like some of the other .cbr readers.
57a078095623ed07ff09d86f;SD card won't show My SD card contents won't show. Please fix.
57a078095623ed07ff09d870;Doesn't work Could not find comics on Droid razr m sd card
57a0780e5623ed07ff09d871;Constant crashes This reader is almost completely useless in my Asus TF101 tablet, since it is contantly crashing with the "not enough memory" error. The only way I can prevent this error from happening is by reducing the image resolution in the settings, but then the image quality is so low that the image displays pixelated.
57a0780e5623ed07ff09d872;Simple n easy One of the best comic viewer, friendly n not too complicated.
57a0780e5623ed07ff09d873;Works as advertised I've been using ACV for months and I can't get enough of it. It is basic, super lightweight, and has support for both Western comics and manga. Everything just works as expected. Put your comics on your SD card, whether as loose images in a folder or a cbz, and you're pretty much golden.
57a078115623ed07ff09d874;Use it every day. Best reader I've found for Android. Lightweight and easy. It rarely has trouble reading .cbr files and loads fast including page changes.
57a078115623ed07ff09d875;Out of memory Doesn't work on my Nexus 7, so 1 star.
57a078115623ed07ff09d876;glitch? bottom of comics are scrambled in this app but work fine on my pc. tried on both of my phones and the same thing happens. hmm
57a078115623ed07ff09d877;Issues lately I've had a ton of files not work on ACV lately, even after clearing memory. I thought they were corrupt files till I tried perfect viewer. Needs fixing and I'll fix my review.
57a078155623ed07ff09d878;Imo I just don't like the user interface
57a078155623ed07ff09d879;Nice Very nice. I am using it every day
57a078155623ed07ff09d87a;Great It works perfectly in my Micromax funbook pro p500. It deserves 5 star.
57a078155623ed07ff09d87b;CBR files crash on Note 2, Nexus 7, Nook Color Works with cbz files, but no matter the device, the program chokes on CBR files - giving an out of memory error.
57a0781a5623ed07ff09d87c;Does not work I had the same issue with the low memory error so i uninstalled it affer only 10 hours.......if this issue gets fixed i would get it again and i qould probabl pay for the premium.
57a0781a5623ed07ff09d87d;PERFECT Perfection !!! good visuals, UI , functionality .!
57a0781a5623ed07ff09d87e;Great app This is a great app. I use it to read several comics and find it excellent. In particular the page transitions are clean and don't get in the way - unlike some comic viewers I've seen. Love that it's open-source too.
57a0781e5623ed07ff09d87f;Lack of memory Was running fine on my Galaxy note till till today saying a message like lack of memory and brought me back to the welcome screen
57a0781e5623ed07ff09d880;Just what I need
57a0781e5623ed07ff09d881;text and images not sharp enough pretty user friendly bit it's pretty hard to read, I prefer Perfect Viewer, a bit harder to use but images look way better
57a0781e5623ed07ff09d882;Used to be great This used to be a great app, but since the last update (ages ago) it sucks. Crashes for most comics I try to read. The latest update also added annoying ads. This app is really not worth it.
57a078225623ed07ff09d883;Needs work Opened comics but wouldn't display long ways on my tablet, forcing me to scroll up and down to see the entire image.
57a078225623ed07ff09d884;Awesome app Just one hiccup, make the recent viewed comics list a bit bigger. It only displays the last two read. Waste of space especially on the screen of a tablet.
57a078225623ed07ff09d885;Brilliant app One of the best apps I free downloaded so far. And because it's on my nexus 7, I am able to download and compress any Web comic and then view them with this. Thank you so much for this great app. My most favourite thing is it manages to open the next comic. I had opened a cbz file labeled as 01 and the next one was 02. It opened the next one in no time. I didn't have to do anything to switch. That was quite a surprise for me.
57a078245623ed07ff09d886;Mm No
57a078245623ed07ff09d887;Great App , i love it it is easy , fast , and have clear history ^_^
57a078245623ed07ff09d888;It's alright. Reads well but there's far too many out of memory problems that ruin the experience.
57a078355623ed07ff09d889;Solution to low memory error This app is not to blame for that error, I received the error on a few files, after some research, it's linked to the technology being used to read the comics. CBR files are the issue. Phones and tablets have trouble with the way they are read. Easiest solution out there: Download a program like (ComicRack) for windows or mac, find your CBR file in the program by using their explorer, right click the file, choose Export Books, then select convert file to CBZ. CBZ files are working fine. no error. There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use "Calibre" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once. Hope this helps, I'm enjoying being able to read on my tablet.
57a078355623ed07ff09d88a;Problem rendering Interface is OK. Too many of my cbr pages end up with garbage at the bottom of page. Prefer moon reader
57a078405623ed07ff09d88b;Let down by memory errors When the app works it's great. Lightweight and unobtrusive. However I get the memory error far too often. Therefore I need an alternative.
57a078405623ed07ff09d88c;Perfect Simple and efficient
57a078405623ed07ff09d88d;problemas con archivos me gustaba mucho la aplicaci√≥n en el celular, pero hay algunos archivos que por una sola hoja cierra todo y dice que hay error, con varios me ha sucedido lo mismo. si lo pueden arreglar, que me parece genial la aplicacion
57a078405623ed07ff09d88e;Frequently crashes (OOM) Frequently crashes with an out of memory message.
57a078435623ed07ff09d88f;Crashes Application crashes frequently with a message telling me to close and reopen it. Seems a but ridiculous to me.
57a078435623ed07ff09d890;Complex and clunky
57a078435623ed07ff09d891;Great A great comic reader.
57a078435623ed07ff09d892;! Can't load some of pages
57a078435623ed07ff09d893;Slow Very slow
57a078465623ed07ff09d894;Great little comic viewing app. Does the job nicely. Simple unobtrusive controls. Clear display. 7 inch tablet is just big enough for reading comics without eyestrain, and it's easy to zoom in to the detail.
57a078465623ed07ff09d895;My nexus 7 is more also showing out of memory :(
57a078465623ed07ff09d896;Out of memory error It's quite useless as I always get the out of memory error eventually, which doesn't happen with other apps.
57a078465623ed07ff09d897;I don't understand Started out great now always getting low or out of memory error. Got it set to low memory still doing it. Have over 2gb on phone free what's up????
57a078495623ed07ff09d898;So close, so far Works great except for the out of memory errors. Restarting the app or even my device makes no change.
57a078495623ed07ff09d899;doesnt read from SD Card on my tablet doesnt read from SD Card on my tablet just reads from internal memory
57a078495623ed07ff09d89a;Well, When It Works It works beautifully, if it does at all.
57a078495623ed07ff09d89b;Ugly Interface Startup interface doesn't utilize screen space well at all. Corrupt file/memory errors are more common than you'd expect. Other readers read the same files perfectly. Overall a decent app that can work, just not always.
57a0784d5623ed07ff09d89c;Brilliant Works great on my galaxy tab 2. You can set the screen size to whatever suits you best, and it reads from the external card. Works with cbr and cbz files, I have really enjoyed reading some old DC comics that made me feel quite nostalgic. Cant beat it seeing as its free!
57a0784d5623ed07ff09d89d;Frustrating Menu keeps coming up while scrolling. Gestures don't always work correctly. Looks good and clean but jittery and buggy in my experience.
57a0784d5623ed07ff09d89e;Good application it will be better if you make your app more smooth and add previews for each pics when locate the pages
57a0784f5623ed07ff09d89f;Totally 100% Tolomus approved really great for hardcore comic fans even for new ones. Best apps ever. Easy to navigate. zoom read etc
57a0784f5623ed07ff09d8a0;Great! Not perfect but still very good!
57a0784f5623ed07ff09d8a1;Greate app!
57a0784f5623ed07ff09d8a2;Nice but.... Sometimes it doesnt read the whole comic and its anoying
57a078525623ed07ff09d8a3;Sad... Its the second time i download this app... my galaxy s2 and wont open i tap on logo pops menu only options are 'share, open, settings' if i go open just goes to my sdcard memory stuff..
57a078525623ed07ff09d8a4;Good Nine
57a078565623ed07ff09d8a5;Slightly better than Onion Comic Viewer In my quest to find a functional comic viewer I ran across ACV. While this program has better page and comic selection navigation it suffers with numerous crashes, just the same as Onion Comic Viewer. It especially fails with graphic novels, which are typically larger files than regular comics. It starts to read until it reaches "maximum memory" (about page 32) then crashes every time I tried to open to the next page. This occurred at almost the same point with larger comics. I have since moved to Comic Rack which has not crashed once, can read very large files and has amazing navigation features.
57a078565623ed07ff09d8a6;Error message I want to give this five stars. This is such an awesome reader, but the fact that I get nothing but memory errors is a bit irritating. Pretty convinced it is the apparently itself because I have way too much memory. Heh
57a0785a5623ed07ff09d8a7;Nice
57a0785a5623ed07ff09d8a8;Worked well...What happened? I had used this app to read comics on my Nexus 7 for the last couple months but now suddenly I keep running into problems where a few pages in and an error prompt comes up. A nearly flawless app now suddenly unable to read anything entirely.
57a0785a5623ed07ff09d8a9;Out of memory error
57a0785a5623ed07ff09d8aa;Very bad Bad due fails to load comic due to out of memory error
57a0785c5623ed07ff09d8ab;Could only handle small sized file Force closed when opening big sized cbr file. It's working very well actually. Open up a file, pinch zoom, next/previous page button.
57a0785c5623ed07ff09d8ac;Needs to change screen orientation Works well. Didn't get much error messages, but I can't change the screen orientation when my device is rotated.
57a0785c5623ed07ff09d8ad;Excelent Best comic viewer:-)
57a0785c5623ed07ff09d8ae;Good app! Good app!
57a078625623ed07ff09d8af;Good, but needs update I liked this reader a while back, but since I started managing my files via Google Drive rather than transferring files back and forth to the SD Card I noticed that this app does not work. It needs to register a URL handler for .cbz and .cbr files. For now I uninstalled and switched to Perfect Viewer.
57a078625623ed07ff09d8b0;Crashing Keeps crashing mid comic
57a078625623ed07ff09d8b1;Needs a LOT of work! Far too many "memory" issues
57a078625623ed07ff09d8b2;Muito bom!! Recomendo, um √≥timo visualizador de HQ's para tablet!
57a0786e5623ed07ff09d8b3;bad really really bad , Komik is much much better and no ads , and smaller in size and u can actually find it in the ur android market . you can even set your main comic folder.
57a0786e5623ed07ff09d8b4;Ok Very messy looking interface. Not intuitive. Wide range of options for viewing your comics though.
57a0786e5623ed07ff09d8b5;Poor Would not read sd card. Useless.
57a0786e5623ed07ff09d8b6;4/5 rans out of memory on larger comics, and sometimes zoom chages between pages, other thab that, works fine
57a078715623ed07ff09d8b7;Genial Recomendable para leer c√≥mics. Ideal para tabletas. Sgs3
57a078715623ed07ff09d8b8;Realy great Perfect for reading commics!
57a078715623ed07ff09d8b9;Frequent error messages It is so frustrating when one of those 'oops' messages come up. It seems to be happening more frequently. Please fix this
57a078715623ed07ff09d8ba;Keeps Crashing Same problem that everyone else is having. "Opps" error has ruined any goodwill I had toward this app.
57a078715623ed07ff09d8bb;Sucks Way to many errors
57a078745623ed07ff09d8bc;Haven't used any others... But I don't plan on it, this one has been great and real easy to use I highly recomend it
57a078745623ed07ff09d8bd;So far Not had any problems yet Only gripe is when I go to the next page of comic and it zooms in. But doesn't ruin it :-)
57a078745623ed07ff09d8be;No SD card support Was really good but now I can't view my SD card anymore... please fix
57a078745623ed07ff09d8bf;Great Just greaaaat. :)
57a078745623ed07ff09d8c0;Memory error Keep getting a memory error on my s3...
57a078775623ed07ff09d8c1;No menu button Seems like a good app. I paid for the premium and I can't even bring up a menu.
57a078775623ed07ff09d8c2;Petty good, but few hiccups. This is an awesome reader. Every now and then ill get some kind of error trying to load certain files, but when that happens I just usually use an alternative reader. I'll be updating to the premium version for the hell of it.
57a078775623ed07ff09d8c3;S'ok Randomly crashes saying it cant load a page. Then it will say "this generally..." and thats it.
57a078775623ed07ff09d8c4;Some bugs. Sometimes images don't load correctly and appear as blank grey at the bottom. I'm not sure what this is about.
57a0787b5623ed07ff09d8c5;Brilliant Excellent app easy to use. Customisable controls make resizing on phone simple. To people with unable to read error, it's a cbr file format issue. Convert file to cbz and it will work fine.
57a0787b5623ed07ff09d8c6;Oops Can't stand the oops error. uninstall
57a0787b5623ed07ff09d8c7;Very Intuitive but has Problems Consistently runs out of memory. This program requires too much effort for leisure time. If it stops running out of memory it could be the best reader out there. Keeping it installed hoping for fixes.
57a0787b5623ed07ff09d8c8;Exactly what i was looking for Good settings, great usability, perfect for me!!!!!
57a0787e5623ed07ff09d8c9;Rubbish No load folder option and claims to be a manga reader yeah good luck this app is an insult to real apps...
57a0787e5623ed07ff09d8ca;Not good. I've got a phone with 2GB of RAM and it is running out of memory?
57a0787e5623ed07ff09d8cb;No updates? Nothing? I've downgraded my review from 5 to 2 stars because I'm having to use another app for cbr files. How long is it going to take to get cbr support out of beta? This would be the best comic reader out there if only the dev would sort out the issues. Until then, I'll be using a reader that actually works.
57a0787e5623ed07ff09d8cc;Good app Best for manga, but not good for. Rar
57a078815623ed07ff09d8cd;Average for now Pretty comfortable and easy to use, but refuses to display some pages that work with all other comic book readers.
57a078815623ed07ff09d8ce;Update add ads popup
57a078815623ed07ff09d8cf;Can't use Galaxy s2, flipping to next page in landscape mode causes possible out of memory messages. I've got plenty of memory free though. Simply can't use it. Other comic viewers work just fine.
57a078815623ed07ff09d8d0;Fail Does not read from sd card even after mounted. Reads from internal memory only. Droid x2
57a078855623ed07ff09d8d1;Would be perfect if... This app has a very nice interface, but struggles too often displaying even simple comic files, while other readers have no issues at all. When they fix its reliability I will give it another shot as well as a 5-star review.
57a078855623ed07ff09d8d2;Spot on
57a078855623ed07ff09d8d3;Could be good but..... Keeps crashing on SGS2 Claims out if memory error as in other reports. Looks good otherwise
57a078855623ed07ff09d8d4;Best Comic Reader Simple, lightweight, customizable.
57a0788c5623ed07ff09d8d5;It ain't too bad. This is a great app, when it works. I would still recommend it, but the message that a memory error has been found is highly annoying. Needs to be fixed as I'm sure there is no memory error.
57a0788c5623ed07ff09d8d6;Slow and Unresponsive Swipe to go to turn page often takes 4 or 5 attempts. Slow to load next page compared to other image viewers.
57a0788c5623ed07ff09d8d7;There's a better option, guys. I don't normally post comments or ratings for apps but I felt it was worth pointing out to people that, while this app does get the job done, it was simply too much of a hassle to use, and 9 times out of 10 a comic would give me a memory crash error at some point. Perfect Viewer has so far performed significantly better for me, and not once have I ran into any problems with it.
57a078925623ed07ff09d8d8;Clean controls, cbr problems It's relatively quick and has nice control settings, but I find it often has odd memory errors in cbr files that prevent their viewing. Perfect Viewer has no problem opening the same files, but I find the usability of this app to be superior - when it works.
57a078925623ed07ff09d8d9;Impresive I think it should have a full 5 stars! It dosnt take up hardly any space it reads comics well, no noticable sluging allthough I think it may have a bug and if you have the right apps you can make your own comics and read them or shair them!
57a078925623ed07ff09d8da;No longer that fast
57a0789f5623ed07ff09d8db;Fast, light, and does what needs to be done! Great app. It's really fast, takes up only 673k of space and remembers which page you were at when you close the app. I appreciate the ability to customize controls...you can tailor it to your reading style.I This is the first and only app review I plan on doing...nothing quite like ACV. A must for comic readers.
57a078a45623ed07ff09d8dc;Nice, but has some problems. Works fairly well. Most comic book archives open and preloading makes sure you can go through them quickly. Has a good amount of options to tweak your experience. One point deduction because it has some bugs and improvement points that have been around forever: I get errors on some archives, and I can never see the full error because it's always cut off ("Can not open archive. This generally happens because ..." Because what??). The main menu always shows the logo in big, and then the last two archives opened. There's so much more you can do with this space. When you zoom, it seems to remember that zoom level for every *other* page, rather than every page.
57a078b45623ed07ff09d8dd;Couldn't make it through one comic. The UI is pretty nice, I guess. Problem is, it couldn't get me through a single comic - the same "Oops" error that everyone else seems to be getting. Perfect Viewer has been working out well enough. It's certainly not "Perfect", but I can actually read my comics, so it's close enough for now.
57a078b45623ed07ff09d8de;Refuses to display image It says I'm low on memory when reading cbr files and therefore refuses to display more pages. Although it recommends to unpack the file, I still think, that the app should be written better so this wouldn't happen.
57a078b75623ed07ff09d8df;Excellent Has no trouble with anything. I had some trouble figuring out how the controls work but only because i didnt really read the description. This is on a galaxy note 10.1
57a078b75623ed07ff09d8e0;Not bad but the swipe need improvement.
57a078b75623ed07ff09d8e1;Ooops errors caused me to delete this app Fix it
57a078b75623ed07ff09d8e2;No preloading Takes time to load every image when reading in sd card, recommend Perfect Viewer by RookieStudio over this app
57a078b75623ed07ff09d8e3;Ooopps...all the time
57a078bb5623ed07ff09d8e4;Good but could use fixing After a while I get a lot of errors saying the app is out of memory which fix themselves erratically and unpredictably so I can never read many files at one go. Other than that I enjoy the app's clean interface and ease of use.
57a078bb5623ed07ff09d8e5;. I dont hav it yet but does it hav moviestarplanet
57a078bb5623ed07ff09d8e6;Hmmm...
57a078bb5623ed07ff09d8e7;oops! used to love this app, now every comic i read comes up with oops! and something about being ou of memory. happens on both my phone and my tablet, both running different roms.
57a078be5623ed07ff09d8e8;Same problem This is the best comic reader by far i ve used. But the oops error is annoying. The app works when it wants to work and thats not a good thing:/.
57a078be5623ed07ff09d8e9;Great Except constant file errors, others don't do this.
57a078be5623ed07ff09d8ea;Unable to load Has a lot of problems loading comics do to a memory issue.
57a078be5623ed07ff09d8eb;Good reader... This app can open manga through zip, it's very useful....
57a078be5623ed07ff09d8ec;5 out of 5 Awesome
57a078c25623ed07ff09d8ed;Pretty Close to Perfect. This app is way better than any comic book reader I've ever used. It's small, it operates fast, and the interface is incredibly clean and simple. Literally my only complaint is the "Oops, Sorry couldn't read" error, which I'm not entirely sure is because of the app. Fantastic application, I recommend to anyone who takes their comics on the go.
57a078c25623ed07ff09d8ee;Best Offline Reader I've tried many comic readers to read the comics saved to my sd card and this is the best by far.
57a078c25623ed07ff09d8ef;Good fer me!
57a078c25623ed07ff09d8f0;Great comic viewing app The best comic / manga / pictorial viewing app.
57a078c55623ed07ff09d8f1;May have gotten higher stars if.. Unfortunately it was stuck on one screen without the ability to check for comic or start reading...perhaps this is due to having the Samsung illusion idk..
57a078c55623ed07ff09d8f2;Simple but Usefull I like apps like this, simple and usefull.
57a078c55623ed07ff09d8f3;Best comic scan app in the market! Worked good on my G1& Droid. Works great on my HTC Thunderbolt.CBZ's & Folders are the best way to view. CBR's sometimes glitch. I convert to CBZ/ZIP mostly.
57a078c55623ed07ff09d8f4;Not very practical There r much better comic viewers than this 4android
57a078ce5623ed07ff09d8f5;Best video game wallpaper app. This app is excellent! It lets me go back and remember all of those enemies in Earthbound that I beat up. The app doesn't drain the battery as much as you might expect. No sneaky ads, popups, or malware originates from the app. And it's free!
57a078ce5623ed07ff09d8f6;Great app. Could use some small updates though - background selector is a bit too small on my LG v10
57a078ce5623ed07ff09d8f7;Good but slightly broken. Amazing affects and brings back memories. Though the selector has no way to change the background. Forcing me to cycle through it via tapping the home screen.
57a078d05623ed07ff09d8f8;Amazing Earthbound was such an amazing game, and now I get to relive those moments through my wallpaper. I would give it 5 star, but there is no Pokey...
57a078d05623ed07ff09d8f9;Great app! Works beautifully. I've had zero issues with it! I've been using this for maybe over a year now and I will never stop using it!
57a078d05623ed07ff09d8fa;Simply Glorious A perfect fit for fans of Earthbound.
57a078d05623ed07ff09d8fb;A hilarious Easter egg While selecting the weird little swirly backgrounds, touch and hold one. Any one will work for the Easter egg to happen. (Anyone know why the Mani Mani Devil's background says "No. 3"?)
57a078d25623ed07ff09d8fc;Adds the extra touche to screen.
57a078d25623ed07ff09d8fd;I can't stop staring at my phone I'm so glad this exists
57a078d25623ed07ff09d8fe;Glitchy At first it worked just finen but after a while of having it, it glitched out! Now the backgrounds are different. I uninstalled it just now. Only one star
57a078d25623ed07ff09d8ff;EARTHBOUND!!! IT.IS.AMAZING!!!!
57a078d25623ed07ff09d900;Amazing I don't know how but this is a near flawless emulation of Earthbounds art style. Bravo whoever made this!!
57a078d35623ed07ff09d901;da best, although I wish there were a mother 3 version of this
57a078d35623ed07ff09d902;Psychedelic MOTHER awesomeness
57a078d35623ed07ff09d903;Amazing app Very cool, I just can't handle the battery drain. Not really the app's fault, though. Any Earthbound fan will love this app.
57a078d35623ed07ff09d904;Great! I am a big Earthbound fan, and this wallpaper is great to compliment the game.
57a078d35623ed07ff09d905;Perfect for any fan. I love EB, and this looks great!
57a078d55623ed07ff09d906;Pretty cool But the thing is, when you first launch it, everything is marked as favorite. It was hell for me just to unfavorite everything else to get what I wanted. Cool app though.
57a078d55623ed07ff09d907;Everything I Wanted I am a huge EarthBound fan and when I saw this, I thought maybe I should try it. It lived up to my expectations, Great Work.
57a078d55623ed07ff09d908;Fix issue It doesn't display on lolipop
57a078d55623ed07ff09d909;Amazing Love this wallpaper, just a couple things. First, a select all option would be really useful. Second, mother 3 wallpapers?
57a078d65623ed07ff09d90a;Earthbound is my favoret game so I aprecate that someone did this and it is super cool
57a078d65623ed07ff09d90b;Excellent Every Earthbound lovers dream
57a078d65623ed07ff09d90c;Great App Works really well and doesn't kill battery! An amazing app for any Earthbound fan! Thank you so much!
57a078d65623ed07ff09d90d;Love it! Brings back memories. Has a lot the bosses and enemies from the game. =)
57a078d65623ed07ff09d90e;PSI Love coming from me! Downloaded it to every android i ever had. Love it. Showed it to a friend. They instantly downloaded it as i showed them a few features.
57a078d85623ed07ff09d90f;AWESOME but there's one problem I love the wallpapers but why can't you pick a wallpaper from the wallpaper picker thing but it's still goodüëç
57a078d85623ed07ff09d910;Exactly what I wanted The background animates seamlessly. Customizability is a nice touch. Gives me warm fuzzy feelings whenever I look at my phone.
57a078d85623ed07ff09d911;Dunno how long I'll want to keep this as my wallpaper, but it works really well. Only slightly disappointed that I can't set this as my lock screen.
57a078d85623ed07ff09d912;Finally I've got my personal Giygas.
57a078db5623ed07ff09d913;Great! I really can't say much here, but this wallpaper works well! I'd reccomend it for just about anyone!
57a078db5623ed07ff09d914;More then words can describe First and foremost thank you thank you THANK YOU to whomever took time to make this app,you are an amazing person 5/5
57a078db5623ed07ff09d915;Perfect for Earthbound fans It has pretty neat options, randomized backgrounds, selection of enemies. I'm really having a hard time finding a good wallpaper replacement after months of use.
57a078db5623ed07ff09d916;I love it ^ ^ I really enjoy these wallpapers.. I love seeing these beautiful images from my favorite video game right on my phone :) Even though they drain my battery..
57a078dd5623ed07ff09d917;Abstract Art I love it
57a078dd5623ed07ff09d918;Love Earthbound? Love this! High quality animation with low battery use. There's always a fun thing to see. Be careful of Gigyas! Any chance of a Mother 3 version?
57a078dd5623ed07ff09d919;Never gets old
57a078dd5623ed07ff09d91a;This Wallpaper Stinks! Any true Earthbound fan would understand that. This wallpaper stinks, quite literally, of nostalgia! Thanks for compiling all of the video drugs (the Earthbound battle backgrounds) and animating them in their full glory. BOING!
57a078de5623ed07ff09d91b;I don,t know how to get to it I have no idea how someone tell me
57a078de5623ed07ff09d91c;It's cool. No problems. Works fine. Little cheesy but its all cool.
57a078e05623ed07ff09d91d;This is Awesome. Where is Diamond Dog? I think you missed Carbon Dog's second form, Diamond Dog or I just didn't see it. Not enough of a problem to subtract from the score I gave though.
57a078e05623ed07ff09d91e;A must for any Earthbound fan! Definitely love the app and it brings back so many memories. A+ :). Not much love for us Earthbound fans out there so nice to see this app.
57a078e05623ed07ff09d91f;Jfk I love Earthbound so much
57a078e05623ed07ff09d920;This app stinks! Works so well~
57a078e35623ed07ff09d921;I don't know where the app is... It says I installed this app but unlike every other app I downloaded it won't create the shortcut to let me use the backgrounds at all. It doesn't even acknowledge that this app even exists on my phone even after downloading. It may be my phone but I never had this problem before or after this app. I would love to use these backgrounds because earthbound was a cool game and I loved the backgrounds.
57a078e35623ed07ff09d922;... wow Wow, just... wow. I love this so much, thank you!
57a078e35623ed07ff09d923;Big bug Downloaded it can't open it in appstore or find it in my files please help. Running Samsung galaxy 3. Edit: I'm stupid 10/5
57a078e45623ed07ff09d924;Dicksinabagbatman This is great. Don't let the darkness win!
57a078e45623ed07ff09d925;AWESOME WALLPAPERS!!!!!!!!! Missing enemies doh...
57a078e45623ed07ff09d926;So good
57a078e45623ed07ff09d927;Great Really works.
57a078e45623ed07ff09d928;It's good. You guys should do the backgroujds for Mother 4 when it comes out.
57a078e55623ed07ff09d929;Amazing This is great! But you are missing some enemy's here though. This is still cool nonetheless! I also hope seeing a Mother 3 one. But that's fine if you don't make one. Thanks!
57a078e55623ed07ff09d92a;Such a cool app Turned off creatures and enjoying the funky backgrounds.
57a078e55623ed07ff09d92b;Awesome Maybe have a launcher for it. I figured it's just on live wallpaper in android a long time ago. I've been using this forever, always cool.
57a078e55623ed07ff09d92c;NICE! I can deselect enemies and select them, I selected, All Giygas
57a078e75623ed07ff09d92d;Way past cool
57a078e75623ed07ff09d92e;Best live screen. What is there not to love?
57a078e75623ed07ff09d92f;Yeah My man
57a078e75623ed07ff09d930;Best Download I love it. You have to be a mother fan but this is great if you are.
57a078e75623ed07ff09d931;Such amazingNess I am a nerd for Earthbound.I just love this app
57a078e75623ed07ff09d932;Everything I could ever want in a earthbound live wallpaper
57a078e75623ed07ff09d933;Awesome background app.
57a078e75623ed07ff09d934;burger burger
57a078e75623ed07ff09d935;Amazing! Any hardcore earthbound fan will love this!
57a078e75623ed07ff09d936;Love it It is rly awesome
57a078e75623ed07ff09d937;Best app I've ever downloaded
57a078e95623ed07ff09d938;I loved it, but it doesn't work anymore... Can you please fix this? It won't stop crashing!
57a078e95623ed07ff09d939;Awesome I love earthbound. This live wallpaper will always bring memories :)
57a078e95623ed07ff09d93a;Yes it's downloading correctly Don't look for an app, check your wallpapers
57a078e95623ed07ff09d93b;FUZZY PICKLES! This live wallpaper app is my favorite so far. Sooo many wallpapers to choose from that are all groovy! It would be also awesome if u groovy guys made mother 3 live wallpapers too. : )
57a078ea5623ed07ff09d93c;Fantastic This app is amazing, I appreciate the hard effort put into it. I really hope you can do the ones from Mother 3.
57a078ea5623ed07ff09d93d;I turned off every background but Giygas. Now I can't use my phone, I'm too scared. Please add a pray function.
57a078ea5623ed07ff09d93e;This is exactly what I wanted in a live wallpaper.
57a078ea5623ed07ff09d93f;Won't open I download it and nothing... literally nothing. I can't even open or do anything. Only option is uninstall
57a078ec5623ed07ff09d940;Needs a few more enemies. Needs backgrounds for Captain Strong, the New Age Retro Hippie, and possibly others. If it has all of them, I will give it 5 stars.
57a078ec5623ed07ff09d941;It's a SMMMAAAAAAASSSHHHH hit! Have I got a great show for you folks tonight! Ka-boom! Excellent options, nostalgic Earthbound enemies, authentic feeling Mode7 background, all around fun wallpaper. A perfect way to be greeted by old gaming memories when you have to call your dad to save your progress. Wholehearted recommendation.
57a078ec5623ed07ff09d942;Yes! This live wallpaper delivers pure joy straight to my heart.
57a078ee5623ed07ff09d943;Omg Really? Found this purely by chance. A very happy accident!
57a078ee5623ed07ff09d944;Absolutely amazing I...I have no words how to explain how this EarthBound (Mother 2) Wallpaper app is. It's just so awesome
57a078f05623ed07ff09d945;Loved this It's incredible
57a078f05623ed07ff09d946;Parfait
57a078f05623ed07ff09d947;Works perfectly On LG G3. Huge fan of earthbound, so thank you!
57a078f05623ed07ff09d948;How can i not love this? As a fan of earthbound i absolutely love this! Runs perfectly on my galaxy s4.
57a078f05623ed07ff09d949;Omg Best app ever. If you're an earthtbound fan like me, this wallpaper is a must.
57a078f25623ed07ff09d94a;SMAAAASH! I just got done beating Earthbound on the WiiU Virtual Console, and was pleased to see that I can use the trippy backgrounds from the battle scenes as wallpaper. No lag and plenty of options to choose from. Everything from Runaway Dogs to the final battle with Giygas is here. Truly a great app for an Earthbound fan.
57a078f25623ed07ff09d94b;Epic Make mother 3 ;)
57a078f25623ed07ff09d94c;Missing Some Sprites I just noticed that Diamond Dog is missing. Any plans to add him, or the "crazy" people?
57a078f55623ed07ff09d94d;Absolutely marvellous I take everything back: no more bugs, still marvellous. Absolutely perfect. I just donated because this is the best thing that happened to me since the discovery of salted caramel.
57a078f55623ed07ff09d94e;Pretty convincing recreation of Earthbound's battle artwork.
57a078f55623ed07ff09d94f;A reason to look at my phone No other spiffy widget or Google Now card can make me look forward to waking my phone as much as this. Mini doses of blissful nostalgia each time.
57a078f55623ed07ff09d950;Positively gorgeous. An excellent tribute to a wonderful game, and a way to keep my phone from ever getting boring.
57a078f75623ed07ff09d951;This is the best Best thing of all time
57a078f75623ed07ff09d952;Awesome! I can't believe this exists, but I sure am glad it does! Awesome work on this. I would recommend changing the scaling mode to Nearest Neighbor in the settings so the sprites don't look blurry. Great live wallpaper, lots of variety.
57a078f75623ed07ff09d953;Where is it I can't find the open or in the menu screen? Its not compatible wtf
57a078f75623ed07ff09d954;Memories I loved playing Earthbound growing up, this lightweight live wallpaper is pure nostalgia
57a078f85623ed07ff09d955;Freaking awesome, and free! There is a lot of love and work here that I'm sure anyone else would have charged for. Absolutely love Earthbound, and this is right up my ally.
57a078f85623ed07ff09d956;Confusing The first question people will ask is "How do I open the app" well you don't. There should really be an explanation to how to find the wallpapers. My friend luckliy found them by randomly changing his wallpaper
57a078f85623ed07ff09d957;Great! It's an EarthBound wallpaper with great variety. I can't find the background manager though.
57a078fa5623ed07ff09d958;Great App Exactly what I was looking for. Decent amount of backgrounds with plenty of customizable options. Would love to see more backgrounds added, or an option to make our own.
57a078fa5623ed07ff09d959;Best animated wallpaper ever
57a078fa5623ed07ff09d95a;Not Fair I can't even open it!
57a078fa5623ed07ff09d95b;(OoO) That's awesome! The only bad thing is that it can't be Ness, Paula, Jeff, or Po
57a078fc5623ed07ff09d95c;If you are a fan of Earthbound, get it This wallpaper has almost every single background and enemy from the game, and you can choose to take off the enemy sprites. Either way, it's awesome.
57a078fc5623ed07ff09d95d;Fantastic Huge earthbound fan and huge fan of this app!
57a078fc5623ed07ff09d95e;This is so cool! Works perfect, thanks!
57a078fc5623ed07ff09d95f;It's awesome earthbound fans will love it
57a078fc5623ed07ff09d960;PARTY! Great backgrounds and Awesome effects. You should add mother three stuff. Or make a Mr. Saturn font. Thanks man
57a078fd5623ed07ff09d961;SMAAAASH!... ing wallpaper My childhood roundhouse kicked me upon seeing this. I love it.
57a078fd5623ed07ff09d962;Incredible This could be the best live wallpaper ever. The most impressive thing about it is the battery life. Hardly notice any difference from having a non live wallpaper before.
57a078fd5623ed07ff09d963;Absolutely perfect
57a079005623ed07ff09d969;This wallpaper stinks!
57a078fd5623ed07ff09d964;Awesome! Big Earthbound fan. Love the app!
57a078fd5623ed07ff09d965;Amazing. A must for any fan of the series.
57a079005623ed07ff09d966;Great app, keeps closing.... It keeps closing my screen when i double tap the screen runs seamlessly otherwise.... Awesome app tho
57a079005623ed07ff09d967;Really cool Has tons of backgrounds with a really cool EarthBound themed interface, best part is it's animated just like the real deal. If anyone uses an LG phone, use the white hole swipe effect. it looks great with this.
57a079005623ed07ff09d968;Best wallpaper app ever! I was actually looking for something else when I stumbled upon this! Its the best wall paper app I've ever seen. And it works perfectly. This is something a true earthbound fan would love. Thank you!
57a079035623ed07ff09d96a;wow, amasing at first i couldnt see it, but you have to change the wallpaper before you can see it. has wonderful settings, and all my favorite battle backgrounds. Bravo. fans of earthbound i recomind this to.
57a079035623ed07ff09d96b;Stellar Exactly what i was looking for, and i adore the menu for picking backgrounds. I'll likely be getting the donator version in the near future.
57a079035623ed07ff09d96c;Amazing I thought I couldn't open it. I'm dumb. Its the greatest thing on my phone!
57a079055623ed07ff09d96d;This is great! I like to see what new encounters I get :^)
57a079055623ed07ff09d96e;Gotta love it This was a good find l. I love earth bound ;)
57a079055623ed07ff09d96f;Love earthbound. This is great
57a079055623ed07ff09d970;It's Like a Waking Dream Never lags, works much better than other apps that attempt to recreate the battle scenes from EarthBound. Highly recommended!
57a079055623ed07ff09d971;I love this app so much At first it didn't show but now its working great! This is an amazing app any fan of the Mother series will love! :D
57a079075623ed07ff09d972;Awesome!
57a079075623ed07ff09d973;Nice J
57a079075623ed07ff09d974;I love this Earthbound is by far is my second favorite game after mother 3. Please make a mother 3 version I'd love it!
57a079075623ed07ff09d975;So I decided to donate because I love this app so much. The donation easter egg is well worth it. This is the best live wallpaper app ever. The developer truly loves and cares for the game the way I'm sure most of you do.
57a079095623ed07ff09d976;The best Thie cranks my nostalgia level to 11. This live wallpaper works flawlessly on my note 4. I loved it so much I donated 1$ to the creater :)
57a079095623ed07ff09d977;Doesn't access any personal data so 10/10
57a079095623ed07ff09d978;Amazing! I love it! I haven't got any bugs but I hope you guys will fix the 'mysterious bug' soon!
57a079095623ed07ff09d979;This is why I love android Much love to the dev. &lt;3
57a0790b5623ed07ff09d97a;Always has been, always will be my wallpaper I've used it with all my Android devices, and it's always worked perfectly, which amazes me.
57a0790b5623ed07ff09d97b;Favourite background As an Earthbound üåè fan I really love this background. It doesn't drain your battery üîã and it still looks awesome. (Giygas one tho üò®)
57a0790b5623ed07ff09d97c;My favorite app ever thank you so much for such an excellent job; absolutely essential for earthbound fans
57a0790b5623ed07ff09d97d;Amazing Never going to need another wallpaper.
57a0790d5623ed07ff09d97e;Awesome! Can you please add mother 3 stuff? :D
57a0790d5623ed07ff09d97f;Beautiful The wallpapers are easy to set up and install, and it looks great!
57a0790d5623ed07ff09d980;Best thing since boobs Seriously. Download and use this.
57a0790d5623ed07ff09d981;Awesome Been using it on my phone for quite some time. Can you make a mother 3 version of this?üòÄ
57a0790d5623ed07ff09d982;Any more like this
57a0790e5623ed07ff09d983;Perfect This is amazing. Much love
57a0790e5623ed07ff09d984;awesome earthbound best game ever
57a0790e5623ed07ff09d985;GREAT But please... PLEASE MAKE A MOTHER 3 ONE...
57a0790e5623ed07ff09d986;This is the coolest live wall paper! I never get bored with it like I do with other live WPs. There are so many constant changes to keep me happy. And you can choose to have it with or without the character in the center. I love it! üíñ
57a079125623ed07ff09d987;Perfection! Works flawlessly on my Moto G. Would gladly have paid for this, but to my surprise it's free! Thanks for the great app!
57a079125623ed07ff09d988;Perfect!
57a079125623ed07ff09d989;Doesn't work I've had this app before on my Droid Razr and loved it. On a Note 3 now and every time I go to run it it's not in my app drawer and in wallpaper settings it's there but when I try to click it it says not installed. Uninstalled/reinstalled, rebooted many times to no avail.
57a079125623ed07ff09d98a;Terrific Great app, works great on my G2. It doesn't have every enemy (I noticed a lack of the Diamond Dog), but it has a ridiculous amount of different wallpapers
57a079155623ed07ff09d98b;Amazing! This is a FANTASTIC app. I bought this because I'm a huge Earthbound fan, but I ended up just using the backgrounds without the enemies because they are beautiful. What is even better is that every time you exit and app and revisit the Home screen the moving background changes. This makes the app a game of Roulette, and with every background being awesome, you'll never be disappointed. I will be using this Live wallpaper for a loooong time.
57a079155623ed07ff09d98c;Best Thing Ever As a huge Mother/EB fan this is an amazing app to have. I personally keep my background on Giygas because I like the dark aspects to the games. üòã
57a079155623ed07ff09d98d;Awesomeness This is definitely worth the download. I also prefer to change the settings from "smooth" to "fast" because the sprites are ripped straight from earthbound.
57a079185623ed07ff09d98e;Perfect It's exactly what I wanted. EarthBound was the second RPG I played as a kid, and this is an awesome Live Wallpaper. If I have any gripes, it's that the enemies seem to be in random order in the list, Pokey's not visible in Giygas' first form, and there's no Diamond Dog. Otherwise, it's perfect. :)
57a079185623ed07ff09d98f;Perfect Great app for earthbound heads. keep up the good work!
57a079185623ed07ff09d990;Grew up playing this Love it. Works great and doesn't drain battery
57a079185623ed07ff09d991;One of the best live wallpapers on the play store! My inner child is doing back flips.
57a0791c5623ed07ff09d992;I love Earthbound. Can't believe I barely found this. Awesome. Thanks.
57a0791c5623ed07ff09d993;A must for earthbound Fans. Perfect for those of us who'd like to take a little bit of Earthbound with you on the go. Customizing when your favorite background shows up and controlling when it switches makes it all the better.
57a0791c5623ed07ff09d994;Luv earthbound Rally good
57a0791e5623ed07ff09d995;Earthbound (Mother 2) Great for Earthbound and Mother fans
57a0791e5623ed07ff09d996;Only half Installs Says it is intalled but only gives me the option to uninstall not open. Using samsung galaxy mega
57a0791e5623ed07ff09d997;Trippy Some of the best and most interesting live wallpapers I've seen.
57a0791e5623ed07ff09d998;??? When I downloaded it I don't see the app appear on my phone: \ please fix.
57a079215623ed07ff09d999;Its this that gets it 3* Everytime I go to far it says " we're sorry abstract art has stopped working please try again later'' so fix that and I will give 5* reggie can go die for hating the mother series...
57a079215623ed07ff09d99a;It wont even let me play the game
57a079215623ed07ff09d99b;Nice!! Looks good on galaxy note 2. The little customization options make this a great live wallpaper.
57a079215623ed07ff09d99c;Mother 2 lover Yes just yes... Who ever you are I love u long time. And ty for this childhood memory
57a079235623ed07ff09d99d;Best Wallpaper Ever! You don't have to be an Earthbound fan to appreciate the awesomeness that is this wallpaper. In fact I've never played the game until I downloaded this. Who knew that the battle screens would look great on high-end phones! I love the fact that the wallpaper changes every time you go back to the home screen. This wallpaper is something worth showing off to even friends that have no clue what Earthbound is. It certainly does not lag on stock android. Overall, this wallpaper is perfect. Great job!
57a079235623ed07ff09d99e;Best This is the best live wallpaper. People think I'm really cool when they see my phone now.
57a079235623ed07ff09d99f;Nice job!
57a079285623ed07ff09d9a0;Waaavy This rules
57a079285623ed07ff09d9a1;Great App Doesn't ask for any
57a079285623ed07ff09d9a2;Not showing up on HTC One M8 I just switched over from my S3 to the HTC One M8 and this wallpaper isn't appearing under my Live Wallpapers, even though another one I had downloaded from the Play Store (the one that comes with Beautiful Widgets) appears.
57a079285623ed07ff09d9a3;This is the only Live Wallpaper to use.
57a079285623ed07ff09d9a4;Help. Wont install on my galaxy centura if you can fix this ill insta 5 stars
57a079295623ed07ff09d9a5;Fantastic Very faithful to a great game.
57a079295623ed07ff09d9a6;Perfect recreation! You're the best.
57a079295623ed07ff09d9a7;Best background ever Its just so perfect!
57a079295623ed07ff09d9a8;AWESOME This is just so freakin cool could you make a mother 3 one?
57a079295623ed07ff09d9a9;Blue blue.
57a0792b5623ed07ff09d9aa;Groovy! Never thought I'd find something like this out there! I especially love the lack of ads and gimmicks! Good job, sir. You've done us all proud.
57a0792b5623ed07ff09d9ab;awesome best app ever please add more at least hippy and porky
57a0792b5623ed07ff09d9ac;It shortens battery life a bit but that's really the only flaw. The backgrounds are amazing and spot on and there are none left out
57a0792b5623ed07ff09d9ad;Awesome app!!!! For an earthbound fan this is amazing! Thanks for The Giygas wallpaper! &gt;:) You cannot grasp the true form of Giygas Attack!
57a0792e5623ed07ff09d9ae;This wallpaper stinks! :) There's no complaints to be made. This wallpaper runs smoothly and never ever crashes or slows down my phone. It also doesn't eat up battery life.
57a0792e5623ed07ff09d9af;No bugs I'm a huge fan of all mother games this is amazing dude great job this thing works like a charm if i hit any real bugs ill let you know honestly
57a0792e5623ed07ff09d9b0;Perfect for Fans If you love EarthBound/Mother, then you love this wallpaper.
57a0792e5623ed07ff09d9b1;Psi Rockin The enemy has left a present. Inside the present was a cookie. Ness took the cookie.
57a079315623ed07ff09d9b2;Great! Does exactly what it says it does. Very easy to pick/choose backgrounds. Fantastic!
57a079315623ed07ff09d9b3;Flaccid no longer! This simple download has cured me of erectile disfunction! A must have for any mother fan
57a079315623ed07ff09d9b4;Perfect Might want to be allowed to change animation rate... other than that, just needs music Edit: turns out that simply changing your selected backgrounds on an s3 does not change the rotation, requires resetting it as your live background.
57a079315623ed07ff09d9b5;Best wallpaper period. Any Mother fan would enjoy this. There has been quite a lot of effort put into it. You should definitely consider creating a Mother 3 version. Outstanding job.
57a079325623ed07ff09d9b6;So sick Oh my god i love this app. Best wallpaper ever. Does everything it says it does, with the added bonus of blowing your mind every time you see your phone . 5 stars for sure.
57a079325623ed07ff09d9b7;Amazing Amazing app
57a079325623ed07ff09d9b8;Best ever! My favorite game growing up. Glad to see that there is so many options and ways to adjust the background.
57a079385623ed07ff09d9b9;You cannot grasp the true form of this wallpaper's awesomeness! I can't think of a thing to complain about with this live wallpaper, except that sometimes after a few minutes the animation goes jerky until you switch to another battle background, and the ticks of which BGs are selected could be way more visible. Even that though can't make me give less than 5 ‚òÖs.
57a079385623ed07ff09d9ba;The best So much memories come flowing back
57a079385623ed07ff09d9bb;It's a SMAAASH! It's easy on the battery, has a great variety of backgrounds to choose from, and still retains that psychedelic retro feel.
57a0793b5623ed07ff09d9bc;Gave me the chills Seeing Giygas going crazy still gets to me. But I love it! Add Heavily Armored Pokey and it would be perfect
57a0793e5623ed07ff09d9bd;Awesome Good
57a0793e5623ed07ff09d9be;Nostalgia ! This makes me smile. So well put together, I can almost feel the controller in my hands and hear the timeless tunes. A must for any smart phone wielding Earthbound fan.
57a0793e5623ed07ff09d9bf;Psi Love Thank you so much dude. I can't express how happy this makes me. This is probably my favorite game ever. I've been really stressed about things lately but now every time I open my phone, my feelings become calm and happy. It's stupid to say but this means something to me. (However I don't get the application for it on my Galaxy s4, please fix!)
57a0793e5623ed07ff09d9c0;Yes! Just wonderful :) wish it had interactive elements such as a smash attack
57a079435623ed07ff09d9c1;:D It's wonderful
57a079435623ed07ff09d9c2;. awesome :)
57a079435623ed07ff09d9c3;This runs waaay smoother than the "Earthbound Battle Backgrounds" app. Plus it's free, and I would have been willing to to pay for this.
57a079435623ed07ff09d9c4;Awesome But... I'm not quite sure what model my zh&k tablet is. I just know that it is a jellybean device. But more to the point, everytime I set this live wallpaper, by the time its set, it comes up saying "Unfortunately, Abstract Art Has Stopped",and closes itself, but brings up a default wallpaper. Fix This if possible and I will Give 5 Stars. I Am A HUGE fan of earthbound.
57a079455623ed07ff09d9c5;Awesome! This is a really great app. One suggestion, add the New Age Retro Hippie enemy. Plus, the first time looking through enemies, a random message that read "Stop, you're squishing me!" I'm still wondering how I did that. Can someone explain that please?
57a079455623ed07ff09d9c6;I like the app, But I cant use it
57a079455623ed07ff09d9c7;Love it!!! I loved the game and it's quirky, modern, trippy 8-bit aesthetics. Great app!!!
57a079455623ed07ff09d9c8;Earthbound love Just amazing. I am absolutely in love with this app. The best wallpaper I've had to date. I can't stop looking at it!
57a079465623ed07ff09d9c9;Really Awesome EarthBound is my favorite game... This app is the best. Thanks.
57a079465623ed07ff09d9ca;Great app Can't believe someone didn't think of this sooner
57a079465623ed07ff09d9cb;Excellent!! Runs great on my LG G2. Nostalgia at its best :)
57a079465623ed07ff09d9cc;Beautiful Amazing idea with amazing delivery
57a079465623ed07ff09d9cd;Magical
57a079485623ed07ff09d9ce;Love it! Clearly a lot out hard work went into making this. Kudos to the developer for including so many backgrounds. This is a must for any EB fan.
57a079485623ed07ff09d9cf;‚Ä¢Abstract Art set up a wallpaper! SMAAAASH!! ‚Ä¢Ness became diamondized!
57a079485623ed07ff09d9d0;Love this These wallpapers really bring me back to the year 199X. Have had this on my phone for months and I still love it! Thanks for making this!
57a079485623ed07ff09d9d1;Smaaashing! Perfectly executed. Sound pack next, please!
57a0794a5623ed07ff09d9d2;SMAAAAAAAAASH!!! Wow! This is absolutely flawless and beautiful. Everyone should get this and also donate. It's just... Wow.
57a0794a5623ed07ff09d9d3;Say Fuzzy Pickles! Awesome application! I've always wanted a Giygas live wallpaper!
57a0794a5623ed07ff09d9d4;Amazing. Awesome idea and it runs perfectly. Thanks!
57a0794a5623ed07ff09d9d5;Nostalgic These are pretty awesome. Although my epileptic girlfriend isn't a big fan, the backgrounds are exactly what I expected. Galaxy S4
57a0794c5623ed07ff09d9d6;Smaaash! Oh this app is my all time favorite live wallpaper. Developer you did a fantastic job. I have one suggestion please make a scrolling hp battery meter. It would make my day.
57a0794c5623ed07ff09d9d7;Smaaaaaaashing! Hands down, the greatest app ever made. Thank you.
57a0794c5623ed07ff09d9d8;This app STINKS! Best live wallpapers PERIOD! Only way it could possibly be better would be to add Mother 3 as a separate option for wallpapers.
57a079515623ed07ff09d9d9;Masterful. I would like to thank you, George, for this incredible creation. Yes, I realize that it is just a wallpaper for my phone based on one of the best video games ever made but I cannot help but appreciate its perfection. It brings me to the wonderful state of mind I was in during those first experiences with that amazing game each time I look at my phone and trust me in that it is a great place. Playing it or not, I am now EarthBound.
57a079515623ed07ff09d9da;Love it It looks awesome, thank you!
57a079515623ed07ff09d9db;Just brilliant So simple, but so perfect. Mother 2 is my favorite game of all time. If you could add Mother 3 characters/enemies, whether it's in this wallpaper as a update or a separate app, I'd happy pay a buck or two for it. :)
57a079535623ed07ff09d9dc;Great All earthbound fans will love it!
57a079535623ed07ff09d9dd;Great work! This is a must have by any Earthbound/Mother fan!
57a079535623ed07ff09d9de;Awesome! But no Diamond Dog? I really do love this app, and now can't think of having anything else as a wallpaper. But you forgot Diamond Dog! Please include him!
57a079535623ed07ff09d9df;Awesome App Small download, works well and appears to be light on system resources. Also, EB nerdgasm.
57a079555623ed07ff09d9e0;Missing Options Awesome, but I see no way to access options (check all, uncheck all) in the chooser without a physical action button. Thank you for creating and open sourcing! Purchased the donation version.
57a079555623ed07ff09d9e1;Best EarthBound app ever I love the variety in my backgrounds now. Constant reminders of my favorite game ever are welcome and awesome. "Potential!"
57a079555623ed07ff09d9e2;Amazing job These wallpapers were just the ones I wanted. Also a suggestion, you should add Mother 3 aswell.
57a079555623ed07ff09d9e3;Personal favorite Love this wallpaper, thank you
57a079595623ed07ff09d9e4;Awesome! I can't believe the amount of customization and detail that went into this. Such a great idea.
57a0795b5623ed07ff09d9e5;Awesome It runs flawlessly and it's always amusing to watch. But please add in Heavily Armed Pokey's sprite. Oh, and yes Mother 3 wallpapers would be excellent.
57a0795b5623ed07ff09d9e6;Great work This is the coolest app in the entire play store. Only way it could be more epic was if you added the ones from Mother 3 as well.
57a0795b5623ed07ff09d9e7;Exactly what I wanted Fantastic! Simple and sublime.
57a0795b5623ed07ff09d9e8;Fantastic! Really nice look. Great options.
57a0795b5623ed07ff09d9e9;Brilliant! Please keep developing!
57a079615623ed07ff09d9ea;My favorite app ever Very well made app, thoroughly enjoy just looking at my screen all day XD. Bought the app without a second thought. Much thanks to the developer!
57a079615623ed07ff09d9eb;Absolutely Amazing If you love earthbound as much as I do (played it as a child on SNES) you will smile every single time you power you phone on and see the live wallpaper change to a new enemy animation. A+++ 10/10! If your phone does not have a live wallpapers icon in your settings, install aniBrush Abstract Live wallpaper, and it will open your live wallpaper settings and you can set it to the Earthbound.
57a079615623ed07ff09d9ec;Suggestion: Add Mother 3! You should definitely add mother 3 enemies and their backgrounds. That would be so cool! XD
57a079635623ed07ff09d9ed;Deserves no less than 5 stars There is a paid version. I can't imagine it could be any better than this. This is all I want in an earthbound live wallpaper. I'm going to now make a go launcher icon pack so that my contacts, aps, sms and camera are Ness, Paula Jeff and Poo. There is just one user who gave less that 5 stars. We should paint him blue.
57a079635623ed07ff09d9ee;Amazing I love you man this is just what I was looking for thank you.
57a079635623ed07ff09d9ef;Fantastic The visuals look exactly like earthbound. I definitely recommend that you try it out!
57a079665623ed07ff09d9f0;Just finished the game today and These look exactly like the game! I think the sprites look a little funny, but I know that's just from blowing them up so big. I might just remove them later. Still love it though! Thanks for making this!
57a079665623ed07ff09d9f1;Cool app! Fuzzy Pickles!
57a079665623ed07ff09d9f2;love it Thank you for this great EB. wallpaper. I also paid the donation for this app. I just wish you tossed in a song or something for the paid version. But all in all it is good, it will be my main wallpaper for years.
57a079665623ed07ff09d9f3;This is the best thing. It really is.
57a079685623ed07ff09d9f4;Great Works perfectly.
57a079685623ed07ff09d9f5;Superb! Absolutely spectacular. Emulates the Earthbound backgrounds beautifully without compromising battery life. A+ Material!
57a079685623ed07ff09d9f6;Awesome app any earthbound fan will love This is the coolest app, I think if it want free people would purchase it. Thanks a ton for making this sick earthbound app!
57a079685623ed07ff09d9f7;Oh Baby! I love Earthbound! This app is great and cool, it is a great condiment for your Android phone item!
57a079685623ed07ff09d9f8;Great! PSI Rockin!
57a0796a5623ed07ff09d9f9;Worth buying a smart phone for. This made it worth the cost of getting a smart phone. Thank you.
57a0796a5623ed07ff09d9fa;Awesome! I always thought the battle backgrounds would make great live wallpapers. Thanks for putting this together! By the way, the background picker references a menu button for more options but the menu is not available on the G.Nexus for some reason.
57a0796a5623ed07ff09d9fb;Boing! 5 Franklin Badges for making such a SMAAAASHing app.
57a0797a5623ed07ff09d9fc;LOVELY Works perfectly well with my phone
57a0797a5623ed07ff09d9fd;Simple epic thing! Allows show pic from multiple folders! Not have limit how much pic can be selected! So now newer boring same wallpaper on phone as can have so much pictures changing after time...
57a0797a5623ed07ff09d9fe;Awesome Awesome
57a0797a5623ed07ff09d9ff;Best
57a0797a5623ed07ff09da00;Works great
57a0797c5623ed07ff09da01;Works.
57a0797c5623ed07ff09da02;works well for me on Note 3
57a0797c5623ed07ff09da03;It's the best
57a0797c5623ed07ff09da04;Aaah I almost lost this app. The best it is
57a0797c5623ed07ff09da05;Excellent Transitions! The live wallpaper transitioning between photos is excellent and very battery saving. I don't feel any difference between using a live wallpaper and a static one in terms of battery usage. Great work and thanks!
57a0797e5623ed07ff09da06;Stopped working after Marshmallow update Was great, but not Marshmallow compatible
57a0797e5623ed07ff09da07;Awesome A few weeks in, and I absolutely love this app. This app is absolutely terrific. And hasn't really drained my battery life yet. I have it on a rotating folder of pictures from trips around the world as my live wallpaper and it just seems awesome. can't feel stronger about it and that's why I gave it 5 stars
57a0797e5623ed07ff09da08;Awesome and the best For those that experience the no photos problem that means your photos are stored on an external or internal SD card
57a0797e5623ed07ff09da09;Jwie Ui2k
57a079805623ed07ff09da0a;Super Thank you
57a079805623ed07ff09da0b;Wow! This app does everything it claims to do. Exceptional!
57a079805623ed07ff09da0c;Would be ok if it used all the pictures from my gallery but only picks a few.
57a079805623ed07ff09da0d;As of the date of this posting it is easy to understand why this application has 5 million downloads. The features this application has are actually too numerous to list here however I would advise anyone to try it for themselves and see. Personally I'm just happy the app has the option to automatically rotate my wallpaper every couple of hours minutes or even days. And surprisingly it doesn't seem to be a battery hog
57a079815623ed07ff09da0e;Love it. Easy to use.
57a079815623ed07ff09da0f;Good It's so good But there's a pronlem
57a079815623ed07ff09da10;I like it but I like it but a better UI would be nice.
57a079815623ed07ff09da11;not bad Crashed few time recently
57a079815623ed07ff09da12;This app has added something to my life. I love watching it for long periods of time. I'm glad that the engineers who designed this included the double-tap feature. It would be cool if there was also a pause feature without an actual pause button.
57a079845623ed07ff09da13;Doesn't work on HTC One
57a079845623ed07ff09da14;Very nice
57a079845623ed07ff09da15;Very nice app Hello.. Please add an feature to set transition effects also in pictures slide show.
57a079845623ed07ff09da16;Super
57a079845623ed07ff09da17;I got 3 screens only my left screen is good one solid full pic I swipe to either of the other 2 screens and I've got half a pic on the left and half a different one on the right I try refreshing and nothing
57a079875623ed07ff09da18;Like Loved it
57a079875623ed07ff09da19;great good app
57a079875623ed07ff09da1a;Required some changes n updation
57a079875623ed07ff09da1b;Best out there The application is wonderful. Works great. Only thing that is bugging me is I have to keep a live copy of the pictures that I'm setting as wallpapers, unlike in TouchWiz UI, where you can delete pics after setting them as wallpapers, and they still remain wallpapers
57a079875623ed07ff09da1c;Black everywhere Didn't work on S7
57a079895623ed07ff09da1d;Picture time isn't working Pictures change every 30 seconds!?!?!
57a079895623ed07ff09da1e;Feedback : This app is not working in unrooted Samsung Note 4 N910G running android 6.0.1.
57a079895623ed07ff09da1f;Ok It's OK but Some times get error stopped
57a079895623ed07ff09da20;Yup.. Used to be a great 5 star app... But it started giving me trouble with my HTC M9 regarding the "cant load image" screen... Then, upgraded to an HTC M10, and the same problem still exists. It's too bad, because this really was a great app. I may download the source, and see if there is something that I can do to fix this problem...
57a0798b5623ed07ff09da21;Worked on Coby kryos MID 8042 It worked almost flawless on my ICS device and had little issues. It just had the problem when it was set to be a scrollable wallpaper.The picture just wont show for some reason. I Thought at first that it would hang as my tablet would but amazingly it performed well enough to be worthy
57a0798b5623ed07ff09da22;Great app!!! Great App for setting multi wallpaper lets you choose any photo u want on your phone.
57a0798b5623ed07ff09da23;Love it Love it
57a0798f5623ed07ff09da24;Good experience overall BUT... I have some issues with it. I have the transition interval set to Never and set images to change on double tap but backgrounds still change at random intervals. Ofttimes when I double tap to change backgrounds it takes over a minute to complete the operation. It shouldn't take so long to select a few random images on a quadcore phone. The app hasn't been updated since 2013. I think it's due time for a compatibility update.
57a0798f5623ed07ff09da25;No shortcut Why there isn't any shortcut on my menu? I always have to enter in Google Play when I want to open the app. How can I solve it?
57a0798f5623ed07ff09da26;I loved it on my old phone Apparently doesn't work for Samsung Galaxy 6 :(
57a079915623ed07ff09da27;Deserve 5 star Perfect app. Does its job. Free with no ads.
57a079915623ed07ff09da28;It's ok I was wondering if you could set one photo for the screen instead of one per each screen,
57a079915623ed07ff09da29;Very good It works very well, my only niggle is due to cloud based drives wanting to suck up every picture folder I choose to hide the folders. But MP doesn't seem to work on hidden folders.
57a079915623ed07ff09da2a;Anas Bilal Great
57a079935623ed07ff09da2b;Can't do what I want How do you put just ONE picture on ONE screen of your menu? It's on 3 pages as I scroll and I only want ONE page to be the photo I want.
57a079935623ed07ff09da2c;My opinion Example of a good app gone BAD
57a079935623ed07ff09da2d;must download this
57a079935623ed07ff09da2e;Works for me Does what it says it does, cant complain.
57a079935623ed07ff09da2f;Not working on My OnePlus One Used to work well on my previous Sony Xperia handset..but now it doesn't work with my new device.
57a079955623ed07ff09da30;Works well but.... Works great but there is this minor issue....it has a tendency of selecting the photos that are top in the folder..
57a079955623ed07ff09da31;This is THE BEST!!! Best wallpaper app ever! I love it and right now I am using the Mo by Dick whale one. It is so great! Amazing!!!!!!!!!
57a079955623ed07ff09da32;Love it!
57a079955623ed07ff09da33;It's ok Fine
57a079955623ed07ff09da34;Cannot hide controls, really? Seems simple enough with enough controls but the settings and slide show controls on the screen cannot be hidden
57a079975623ed07ff09da35;ÿπÿßŸÑ€åŸá
57a079975623ed07ff09da36;Nice app.
57a079975623ed07ff09da37;I love it! I have 1 problem though. Sometimes the wallpaper is just black, and to get the pictures back I have to go back into the app and press set.
57a079975623ed07ff09da38;s4 custom lollipop... same pic same pic showed even using different folders as suggested by another. probably bec of custom rom? good luck programmer-- not easy i know!
57a079975623ed07ff09da39;Very good
57a079995623ed07ff09da3a;Nova launcher update This is a Amazing app, guys when choosing a picture, make sure you come out of the default picture screen, and choose from your own gallery, hope this helps you out
57a079995623ed07ff09da3b;Very best app
57a079995623ed07ff09da3c;Multi Very good app for NY lenovo cell thanks

57a0799c5623ed07ff09da47;Ok Useful and acceptable
57a0799c5623ed07ff09da48;Works great
57a0799c5623ed07ff09da49;Very Good Transition type doesn't work, need some fix but otherwise it's overall good and useful.
57a0799e5623ed07ff09da4a;Doesn't work, deleted
57a0799e5623ed07ff09da4b;Before lollipop the lock screen settings worked great now i can't set a pic for my lock screen
57a0799f5623ed07ff09da4c;Great with nova launcher!! Works great with nova launcher. Only wish it could auto detect picture orientation and have option for only portrait or landscape from directory.
57a0799f5623ed07ff09da4d;It's awesome just a problem I could give it a five star if it would change the lock screen wallpaper
57a0799f5623ed07ff09da4e;Once a great app, now abandon ware. Where are updates?
57a0799f5623ed07ff09da4f;Livewallpaper Up
57a079a15623ed07ff09da50;Amazingly beautiful Random selected wallpaper whenever you scroll desktop to next screen..
57a079a15623ed07ff09da51;In motog2 its working smoothly.
57a079a15623ed07ff09da52;Can't get it to work on xperia Z1
57a079a15623ed07ff09da53;I love this App. Every time i get a new phone i come for this app. Great
57a079a35623ed07ff09da54;It's got problems It freezes my LG G4 and I have to take out the battery to get it back to work. Can't even turn off the device holding the power button for no matter how long. Happens especially when I plug it into a charger.
57a079a35623ed07ff09da55;Very Handy
57a079a35623ed07ff09da56;Perfect, simple and works great Even many plugins, you can get pictures from panoramio near you whiteout doing nothing... Obviously paid donation cheap version, it worth less than 2 bucks...
57a079a65623ed07ff09da57;Working good in Sony but not in HTC In my HTC 820 ƒü plus, it's not working for setting wallpaper on each screen but for my Xperia M5 it's too good.. Please let me know once you fix so that I can revise the star rating to 5 :-)
57a079a65623ed07ff09da58;This is so sweet its wicked Best live wallpaper ever thanks for making this its awesome
57a079a65623ed07ff09da59;Does not support for Touchwiz works beautifully on nova ( in nova setting select wallpaper scrolling on). And doesn't work on touchwiz.
57a079a65623ed07ff09da5a;I loved it As a photographer I use Google Photos to backup my photos. It's great to use my phones backgrounds as a picture frame.
57a079a95623ed07ff09da5b;Worst app.. It is the app evr
57a079a95623ed07ff09da5c;It works Menu could be setup a little better, but no complaints. Works well & doesnt seem to affect battery life too much
57a079a95623ed07ff09da5d;perfect - have been searching for ages for an app that will display my google photos as wallpaper...this does it brilliantly...excellent work!
57a079a95623ed07ff09da5e;love it but lately. using with NOVA launcher, set as landscape mode. when handphone locked, and unlock. the wall paper does not set multi as set, only displaying the first page wallpaper for all pages. when i click on any app. the exit, then only the multi wallpapers appear. can you give me any procedures on how to solve this? thanks. good app btw
57a079ab5623ed07ff09da5f;Perfect Just what I was looking for. This is the coolest app around. I'd been trying to find one like it for a while. Thanks to the genius developer.
57a079ab5623ed07ff09da60;Meh It works better than the others
57a079ab5623ed07ff09da61;10/10 Best app for people who take customization serious!!!!!
57a079ab5623ed07ff09da62;Excellent I've tried and rejected about 5 other slideshow wallpaper apps but I stopped at this one. Works exactly how I want it to so far. And I'm surprised it's free... I usually have to pay for a decent app. (It asks for a donation, but it's not required.) Don't see any ads so far. Lovin' this.
57a079af5623ed07ff09da63;Nice which I was looking for But the black shade on top and bottom is missing.
57a079af5623ed07ff09da64;Nice app Simple n nice features. Loved it.
57a079af5623ed07ff09da65;Multipicture live wallpaper Unable to load single picture into each of 5 screens
57a079af5623ed07ff09da66;Thank you for the program. The Singe picture option did not work for me, all it displayed was the black error box. What I got was screens that revolve through my pictures. What I wanted to do is to be able to set one picture as the background on page 1, a separate picture as background for 2, and a third picture for page 3. I wanted them to stay at the picture until I changed them. I was not able to find a way to accomplish this.
57a079b05623ed07ff09da67;very good
57a079b05623ed07ff09da68;Stops workin after 6h Title says it all
57a079b05623ed07ff09da69;Very handy Must use if u like different wallpaper on Ur mobile screen
57a079b05623ed07ff09da6a;Was great on Galaxy S2 Haven't got it to work on new S5. Still trying workarounds. Shame! I liked this one.
57a079b05623ed07ff09da6b;Nice and simple!!
57a079b25623ed07ff09da6c;Double tap problem When I have the double tap option open that says you can change the picture when you double tap, it does not change. Instead I look like an idiot tapping nothing on my screen. Otherwise, it's a good app.
57a079b25623ed07ff09da6d;Galaxy Tab S Does note work. Displays home screen picture but does not transition to next picture. Same home screen picture on all screens.
57a079b25623ed07ff09da6e;Doesn't work Doesn't work on Android 5.1
57a079b25623ed07ff09da6f;Lock screen Despite adjusting the setting several times your app will not allow the pictures to show on my lock screen. Please fix
57a079b55623ed07ff09da70;OooossssdooooMmmm Nice apps .. Love it
57a079b55623ed07ff09da71;Works well! Great live wallpaper.
57a079b55623ed07ff09da72;Ah I've used this app every time I've gotten a new phone. Doesn't work now with my note 5 : (
57a079b55623ed07ff09da73;No go for Note 4
57a079b75623ed07ff09da74;Fantastic app One of the best wallpaper app. Would love to see it include gif too.
57a079b75623ed07ff09da75;Asus ZENBOOK 8.0 When turning the screen the picture won't move or change! Worked fine on other devices but doesn't work at all with Asus new line of tablets. Please fix!!!
57a079b75623ed07ff09da76;Kavin Around more than a year i was using this app. Now my HTC desire eye was updated to lollipop now the individual home screen cant set with different images. Try to fix it.
57a079b75623ed07ff09da77;Finally one that works! Note 5
57a079ba5623ed07ff09da78;Does what i actually wanted but... The transitions are always fade and this app crashes when i open an app that needs more cpu usage
57a079ba5623ed07ff09da79;Well....finally working. Before it had always shown: picture unavailable etc. How I made this work: I'm running the note 4 with nova launcher. I use 3 home screens. Therefore I created 3 folders i file manager and put the wallpapers I wanted to use in them. Open live wallpaper then select MP live. Create your screen settings pages (home screen pages). Remember, picture source= picture folder. Use the folders you created for that particular screen. I also used the honeycomb tablet workaround option. Hope this helps.
57a079ba5623ed07ff09da7a;Great app with low memory consumption
57a079bb5623ed07ff09da7b;Awesome app...
57a079bb5623ed07ff09da7c;Good Very gud
57a079bb5623ed07ff09da7d;I rarely give 5 stars but..‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê This app absolutely deserves it. I've tried several other multi screen wallpaper apps. They were all failures. This one gets it right. The only improvement I can think.
57a079bb5623ed07ff09da7e;Awesome But how do u get a new picture source
57a079bb5623ed07ff09da7f;good love it
57a079bc5623ed07ff09da80;Although it hasn't been updated anymore, but still a nice live wallpaper. If only it could give more options such as music album wallpaper. Muzei is heavier compare to this.
57a079bc5623ed07ff09da81;Works well UI could use some work but works for me
57a079bc5623ed07ff09da82;Good
57a079bc5623ed07ff09da83;Does what it says . Love it.
57a079bc5623ed07ff09da84;Great Works smoothly in my samsung device.
57a079bf5623ed07ff09da85;NothinG likE This !! Great Job ..
57a079bf5623ed07ff09da86;I love this app
57a079bf5623ed07ff09da87;Issue? Used to love this app, worked great. Since I updated the os on my Samsung nook tablet, I would choose which albums to use, but after so many minutes, it goes to albums that I did not choose, and won't auto change. Until this can be corrected, I'll have to use something else.
57a079bf5623ed07ff09da88;Not working on my xperia sp, fix it pls
57a079bf5623ed07ff09da89;Not working Couldn't set diff wallpaer on diff screens. UI unfriendly. Uninstalling...
57a079c25623ed07ff09da8a;Needs more improvement It is a great app but the homescreen and lockscreen should have individual settings so that it doesn't have the same pictures showing. Gave it a 3, though.
57a079c25623ed07ff09da8b;Works like it's supposed to on my phone.
57a079c25623ed07ff09da8c;Awesome App... but... Had this on my Samsung Galaxy 2 and I can honestly say it's one of the best Apps I ever downloaded, as it did EXACTLY what it said it would do (so few do). Absolutely GUTTED it won't work on my Samsung Note 2. Puh-Leeze update or advise of a work-around that works. Using Go works, but would rather not...
57a079c55623ed07ff09da8d;Amazing Tried a couple of sluggish apps, but this is coded very clean and fast, amazing . great Job! Also all these idiots with Korean Taiwan phones complaining, lol get a Sony or Apple!
57a079c55623ed07ff09da8e;Very good but... Isn't there an option to keep same wallpaper to all the screens? I use 3 screens and it shows 3 different photos for each screen but I want to keep only one wallpaper to all the three screens. Please advice
57a079c55623ed07ff09da8f;Awsome
57a079c85623ed07ff09da90;Really good The perfect app for making your own wallpapers, easy to use and has every option you can think of. Only problem is that the change interval doesnt work and won't display on lock screen.
57a079c85623ed07ff09da91;Great My exsd card has tons of fan art on it. I love having diff wallpaper. Every two hours. But I don't like if I have to restart my phone I have to reset the wallpapers.
57a079c85623ed07ff09da92;Perfect! Pic for each 5 screens. Xperia TL has five screens and I've chosen a different picture for each one. They will change at intervals or when I double tap, but what I like most is sliding the screen and seeing the picture turn -so neat and 3D. Never has hung up or caused problems. Highly recommend....works just as well on Moto X2 - still lovin' it!
57a079ca5623ed07ff09da93;piece of garbadge doesnt work on my nexus 5
57a079ca5623ed07ff09da94;Can't select a directory Can't control the section of pix at all, it just seems to display all images on the phone. Fail.
57a079ca5623ed07ff09da95;Doesn't work This doesn't work for Samsung Galaxy S5
57a079ca5623ed07ff09da96;Maybe? Kinda complicated and time consuming setting it up! May work fine once done. I couldnt get it set up! Dwayne- HTC DESIRE 816
57a079cc5623ed07ff09da97;Newish bug Have used this in the past, however restarted recently and the wallpapers no longer lineup. Each swipe moves through almost 1.25 rotations instead of just one. Wish it would be fixed.
57a079cc5623ed07ff09da98;Does not work on Galaxy Note 5 I've tried to set it up to work, but the images don't come up. Works on all other devices.
57a079cc5623ed07ff09da99;Best Simply the best...
57a079cc5623ed07ff09da9a;Its perfect
57a079d05623ed07ff09da9b;Not working at all on my HTC One M9 with Nova Launcher. Just a black background with the message "Screen n: Picture is unavailable. Need to setup or reload." I chose the picture for a couple of screens right from the gallery this app presented, and I restarted the device, too. No joy.
57a079d25623ed07ff09da9c;Galaxy Note 4 Doesn't work.
57a079d25623ed07ff09da9d;missed you havent had this in a while
57a079d25623ed07ff09da9e;Galaxy s4 Does not work for individual pictures on each page.
57a079d25623ed07ff09da9f;Simple and effective Needs screen rotate
57a079d25623ed07ff09daa0;Good but some bug
57a079d55623ed07ff09daa1;Its ok Its good and all but I would like to suggest something, it should let you choose which pictures you want as your background and put it as a sideshow. Other than that is is cool.
57a079d55623ed07ff09daa2;Works. Thank you very much. I've been looking for something like this.
57a079d55623ed07ff09daa3;I love the App I Love the app but the screen transitions doen't work
57a079d55623ed07ff09daa4;Works well. Great program and one of the few of boy multiple wallpaper programs out there. It'd be an easy 5 stars if it were up to date. Hasn't been updated since Feb of 2013 so small bugs are appearing as the operating system continue to advance.
57a079d75623ed07ff09daa5;Mast hai... Really it doesn't crop wallpaper...
57a079d75623ed07ff09daa6;Very good app
57a079d75623ed07ff09daa7;Problem On Lg g4, using Google launcher, wallpaper goes black every once in awhile, gotta change wallpaper then set it back to this for them to work, please fix this
57a079d75623ed07ff09daa8;Not compatible with Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, apparently.
57a079dd5623ed07ff09daa9;Love it It works fantastic on galaxy s 4's. shows all of my picture and if u don't like that picture that on my home screen all I have to do is tap it twice but the only thing about it is when all the picture are over with your screen is black but all you have to do is tap it again and that it goes but that the only thing wrong with app I have so far
57a079dd5623ed07ff09daaa;COOL!! This damn app... is working great at my phone... it good! Thnks to the creator of this^_^
57a079e15623ed07ff09daab;I had this plus Nova launcher on my Note 2, which was 2 years old; it worked well except sometimes the picture wouldn't change worth wallpaper scrolling. Now I have a brand new Note 5 and the pictures not changing with wallpaper scrolling on Nova launcher is more frequent than my Note 2. Of course this could be Samsung's fault or Nova's fault, it makrs me give 4 stars instead of 5.
57a079e15623ed07ff09daac;Doesn't work on Samsung Galaxy Alpha
57a079e15623ed07ff09daad;No comment Nice app

57a079e55623ed07ff09dab4;Smooth, accurate scaling and great performance Excellent quality image scaling and great performance. (Using app with single, screen sized image to overcome cropping limitations on static wallpapers.) Great app.
57a079e55623ed07ff09dab5;Still one problem Not working for lock screen of galaxy s5
57a079e55623ed07ff09dab6;Awesome app! Allows me on changing wallpapers on all different screens. Deduct one point for a functionality I want, which is being able to show as a caption the folder and file names of the image being displayed.
57a079e55623ed07ff09dab7;Love it so tat I cn see all my beautiful wife's pictures
57a079e95623ed07ff09dab8;Good I don't know how to work for lock screen yet
57a079e95623ed07ff09dab9;Not working Says to reload pic.
57a079e95623ed07ff09daba;Love seeing my pictures This program works great u can set up with certain pics and folders or just let it go thru all your pics.
57a079e95623ed07ff09dabb;Like these wallpaper thingie
57a079e95623ed07ff09dabc;Absolutely love it....i have no problems with this app at all.. You just really have to read and its awesome!!!!!!
57a079eb5623ed07ff09dabd;Overall pretty good I just cannot get the same wallpaper for both lockscreen and homescreen if I want to darken the lockscreen
57a079eb5623ed07ff09dabe;Galaxy S5 Doesn't work on S5 lollipop....very disappointing
57a079eb5623ed07ff09dabf;Nice Nice wallpaper changer on Lenovo a889 n Lenovo k3 note
57a079eb5623ed07ff09dac0;Love Has been my favorite wallpaper app for a few years!
57a079eb5623ed07ff09dac1;Very nice. Highly customizable.
57a079ef5623ed07ff09dac2;Yay A.=a
57a079ef5623ed07ff09dac3;Did not work App don't work in samsung galaxy e7
57a079f15623ed07ff09dac4;Works well Works well but you might get stuck in the menus
57a079f15623ed07ff09dac5;Does not work anymore. Used to be able to have a different picture on every screen. No longer works. Tried all kinds of work around
57a079f15623ed07ff09dac6;Not good black Gape between two picture shown when picture changing.
57a079f15623ed07ff09dac7;Good App
57a079f15623ed07ff09dac8;Loving it! All favourites wallpaper in a click!
57a079fe5623ed07ff09dac9;Awesome Live Wallpaper But Reduce Its Memory Usage It's A Awesome Live Wallpaper In It's Category But Its Not Applying Every Wallpaper In The Selected Folder In Mobile Means Many Times By Double Clicking It Applies The Wallpaper Which Is Applied Before Also I Mean Its Repeating The Same Walls again N Again So Please Update The App So That It Should Apply Every Wallpaper In The Selected Folder For At Least Once!!!
57a079fe5623ed07ff09daca;Does half the work on Note 4 It changes pictures normally, but setting individual screen settings doesn't work. It'll always read common settings or screen 1 (if it was configured). I still use it, but I miss been able to have a different picture per screen.
57a079fe5623ed07ff09dacb;Superb app Its really work good
57a07a015623ed07ff09dacc;Poor Doesn't work on samsung A5
57a07a015623ed07ff09dacd;App seems good Nice....
57a07a015623ed07ff09dace;The stupid setting would never move off my screen and I could not actually put a wallpaper on my nook
57a07a015623ed07ff09dacf;love it. shows full pic on s6 edge rather than the 3d swivel zoomed in.
57a07a015623ed07ff09dad0;Doesn't work on my Samsung s6 Loved it when it worked..got a new phone and app says can't load picture. Sad sad sad
57a07a025623ed07ff09dad1;Love it
57a07a025623ed07ff09dad2;Problem when switching screens When I switch between home screens, my images will change as well. I have set the special settings to no transitions when I switch between home screens, but it doesn't help.
57a07a025623ed07ff09dad3;The best app
57a07a025623ed07ff09dad4;üëå ok Um ya

57a07a045623ed07ff09dad8;I've been using this app for as long as I've had this phone. The app is simply amazing.

57a07a085623ed07ff09dae3;No updates Doesn't work on newer phones. App was abandoned but works great on older phones
57a07a0a5623ed07ff09dae4;Brilliant ...
57a07a0a5623ed07ff09dae5;Awesome Amazing, love it . it's such a good app. I think you should download
57a07a0a5623ed07ff09dae6;V.nice
57a07a0a5623ed07ff09dae7;Beast app ever Loving it
57a07a0a5623ed07ff09dae8;Omg. So good
57a07a0a5623ed07ff09dae9;Freezes It freezes on 1 picture from time to time
57a07a0f5623ed07ff09daea;Fantastic app......so beautiful to see so many changing pics in the mobile screen.....and doesn't consume battery too.... Wonderful work developers.....
57a07a0f5623ed07ff09daeb;Great job Really like this app! Great job!
57a07a125623ed07ff09daec;One thing I only wish this app was able to switch wallpapers faster than an hour, like maybe every 30 seconds and every couple minutes.
57a07a125623ed07ff09daed;Perfect app for multiple wallpapers
57a07a125623ed07ff09daee;Good for beginners This app gives you vast effects, tools, etc. But if you want a professional wallpapers maker it is not worth it.
57a07a125623ed07ff09daef;T hate it so much
57a07a125623ed07ff09daf0;Great! No need to crop my picture,can view full image
57a07a155623ed07ff09daf1;Doesn't work anymore. Use to love the app, but it doesn't show the pictures at all after selecting them.
57a07a155623ed07ff09daf2;Screens not changing My wallpaper isn't changing when flipping thru screens. I'm on a Galaxy S5. Don't know how to fix it.
57a07a155623ed07ff09daf3;Average Not very well
57a07a155623ed07ff09daf4;Verry nice app works well on my lg g3 vigor which dosnt have this feature but the the regular g3 does and i wanted something to work like that and u made it nice work üòúüëçüëä
57a07a175623ed07ff09daf5;Bomb Second to none
57a07a175623ed07ff09daf6;Abandoned Abandoned and broken on lollipop
57a07a175623ed07ff09daf7;Not working now On my Note 3 updated to Lollipop, it keeps switching to one picture on each screen. If I open and close a program it goes back to the pictures I've chosen for each screen. Can be frustrating since I have invisible icons that are illustrated by each screen, but can't use them when multiple pics won't show.
57a07a175623ed07ff09daf8;An amazing app It's a great app and is perfect for customising each screen! Love it.
57a07a1a5623ed07ff09daf9;Amazing Incredible
57a07a1a5623ed07ff09dafa;Love this wallpaper!
57a07a1a5623ed07ff09dafb;Underappreciated This app is phenomenal. Tiny data size, simple and easy to control UI that does not complicate the procedure but is able to execute a complex service. Built in fixes for known issues with certain phone and tablet screens and the ability to designate specific wallpapers per screen is very handy. I have yet to have an issue and enjoy the app.
57a07a1a5623ed07ff09dafc;This is a really great app . just make sure you do the correct file path to photos .etc. I highly recommend it ! Very nice app !
57a07a1d5623ed07ff09dafd;Transitions Many transition option but no matter which is selected the result is just a simple fade. I'd like to see the other types.
57a07a1d5623ed07ff09dafe;So COOL!!! This is amazing, that's all I can say!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
57a07a1d5623ed07ff09daff;Does absolutely nothing I installed it to have a different wallpaper for each screen, but no matter what I do, it always uses Screen #1's wallpaper for all other screens. How is this any different from choosing a home screen wallpaper using Android's default settings?
57a07a1d5623ed07ff09db00;Nyc
57a07a205623ed07ff09db01;I usually love this app but when I got my Samsung Galaxy tab S it will let me do the wallpaper for each SCREEN BUT I have to open & close this app to get the different wallpaper screens going.
57a07a205623ed07ff09db02;Multi picture live wallpaper Works Great on my Nexus 7 so far! Not one single problem yet!
57a07a205623ed07ff09db03;Good Like this.
57a07a205623ed07ff09db04;awesome Just what I was looking for, although I'm having issues with the transfer of pictures. I change to a different option but it stays the same... any help?
57a07a225623ed07ff09db05;Do not install!!! It invaded and buried itself on your phone. Do not install this app!!!
57a07a225623ed07ff09db06;Wallpapers work fine but... It won't change anything on my lock screen. I'll set it up same as my wallpapers and then it just doesn't seem to take. But only on the lock screen do I have issues. What am I doing wrong?
57a07a225623ed07ff09db07;Good
57a07a225623ed07ff09db08;Nice
57a07a225623ed07ff09db09;Junk Keeps crashing no good waste of time
57a07a245623ed07ff09db0a;Works perfect on my Droid Turbo
57a07a245623ed07ff09db0b;Cool. Been using this for a couple years now. A staple app in every droid device i have. Does what it says it will, simple interface, no bothersome endless updates....no B.S.
57a07a245623ed07ff09db0c;Great app But it can't set single wallpaper that can be scrolled, but instead changes wallpaper for every screen scroll.
57a07a245623ed07ff09db0d;Nice
57a07a265623ed07ff09db0e;Would love it, but... Running Note 2. Super disappointed that doesn't work here. If I'm screwing up somewhere, please advise and I'll reinstall.
57a07a265623ed07ff09db0f;Just doesn't work on Galaxy S5 The BG set in the first page always shows up, on all pages.
57a07a265623ed07ff09db10;Lovely
57a07a265623ed07ff09db11;Worst. Program. Ever. Worst program ever
57a07a265623ed07ff09db12;With the right background this can make any phone sexy.
57a07a2c5623ed07ff09db13;Laggy The slide shifts aren't fluid.
57a07a2f5623ed07ff09db14;Seems like a winner I just a folder full of pictures that I wanted to rotate through as wallpaper and this app did the trick. Customizable to allow different timing between pictures. For me, it's perfect.
57a07a2f5623ed07ff09db15;Good app but uses a lot of ram!
57a07a2f5623ed07ff09db16;Only one photo on all screens. I'm only getting one photo on all desktops on s5 lollipop, used this for years on many other phones and versions of Android.
57a07a335623ed07ff09db17;Great, but huge bug Works exactly as advertised, but the app doesn't appear in the drawer on my phone. I've tried reinstalling it but it doesn't work. I can't get it on my home screen in my custom launcher without reinstalling it, and otherwise I just have to quit the launcher to use it. Although it's fixable with a reinstall, as stated, this is NOT user-friendly. At all. Please fix!
57a07a335623ed07ff09db18;Unsure Doesn't seem to work with Motorola Droid Turbo and/or Nova Launcher, my home screen app.
57a07a335623ed07ff09db19;Please come back Old rating because it worked VERY well and still works in my Nexus 7 2012, but doesn't work on my Nexus 5 at all.
57a07a355623ed07ff09db1a;Great app! For some reason, this app does not show up in my apps drawer (using nova). Also, I would really love to be able to have wallpaper scrolling, so that I won't be stuck with a cropped version or a small scaled down version.
57a07a355623ed07ff09db1b;Does everything you want Could do with a bit of polish though. Most complete wallpaper app I've seen
57a07a355623ed07ff09db1c;Please update I've been using this for a very long time and it really needs a update
57a07a385623ed07ff09db1d;Great App for me... We give it 100***** ,my destination STOP to this app, I search long time this kind of app but now get it... very very God Blessed to Maker !!! Today I am more HapPy because we get, what we most want in app. Thank you alot Developers.!!!
57a07a385623ed07ff09db1e;Cool but I wish you can pick out the pictures you want..
57a07a385623ed07ff09db1f;Not working on my Xperia Z3 I'm a fan of this app when I was still using my Xperia Go. But when I switched to Xperia Z3 and downloaded this app, "Picture is unavailable. Need to setup or reload" always appear no matter what picture I choose. Help please.
57a07a385623ed07ff09db20;I love it.
57a07a3b5623ed07ff09db21;Nice program for variety of screens Resizes different shaped photos smarter than most programs. But the double tap to change wallpaper is not good since any time you double tap inside some app this senses it and changes even if you don't want to.
57a07a3b5623ed07ff09db22;Never worked for me. Either shows random pics instead of the ones I choose or doesn't show a pic at all
57a07a3b5623ed07ff09db23;Love this app
57a07a3b5623ed07ff09db24;I I love this app
57a07a3b5623ed07ff09db25;So cool Awesome
57a07a3e5623ed07ff09db26;Works well Works well no problems from it at all
57a07a3e5623ed07ff09db27;Set screen Have to be able to add and take away a screen please work on it from Malcolm.
57a07a3e5623ed07ff09db28;Not working Read the reviews, seemed promising. But after installing and fiddling with it for 15 min, couldn't't manage to have the pictures I wanted on three screens. Read the comments more attentively, and seems like that on Nexus 5, you need to use quite a few workarounds to make it work. Doesn't work unless you use album mode, which is not what I wanted to use it for. Same for screen lock.
57a07a405623ed07ff09db29;Nice.. Instead of desaturate, why don't you guys alao add a blur effect on the wallpaper. That would be nice ;)
57a07a405623ed07ff09db2a;Please update for latest android Nice product. You don't have to look at same wallpaper.
57a07a405623ed07ff09db2b;Amazing app. Just what I was looking for. So many options. Couldn't be better and I highly recommend it!
57a07a405623ed07ff09db2c;Good app but... It doesn't works all the time. Sometimes it doesn't want to get a picture from the SD card. :/
57a07a435623ed07ff09db2d;Can't remember how to set the pictures I want
57a07a435623ed07ff09db2e;Good, but needs improvements Nice app, did exactly what I wanted, simple but effective. However the text should be reviewed since it is a bit hard to understand. Also, is there some way to add an option where the picture changes whenever I unlock my phone?
57a07a435623ed07ff09db2f;Doesn't work properly Does not work with touch wiz on my note 4 plz fix
57a07a435623ed07ff09db30;Need a lot of work Takes forever
57a07a445623ed07ff09db31;Does what it says. It would be great if it could also play animated gifs so it could be really close to being 'live' wallpaper.
57a07a445623ed07ff09db32;Great for fun!
57a07a445623ed07ff09db33;It suck Never my this mistake I did never download this app
57a07a445623ed07ff09db34;Stevie Love it. No problem so far.
57a07a445623ed07ff09db35;Doesn't change wallpaper when i scroll fix it i am using grand 2
57a07a485623ed07ff09db36;Dont work.on sony z2
57a07a485623ed07ff09db37;Works great I only wish it did animated gifs.
57a07a485623ed07ff09db38;Why can't I just pick 8 pictures, one for each home screen? Its like being retarded by an app. I'll have another try but I've had no joy so far. It just randomly picks the next photo and if you have a fair few hundred pictures and photos it just becomes a random, any photo from any album mash up.
57a07a485623ed07ff09db39;Awesome Been using this for years... Just excellent
57a07a4f5623ed07ff09db3a;Didn't work I used to have this app, now it doesn't work. I went through my pictures and when I found the one I wanted, I selected it, only to find that my background isn't even the picture I chose! I tried getting back to change the wallpaper, but all I get is the setting page.
57a07a4f5623ed07ff09db3b;This does not work on Galaxy tab 4 please fix, add work around or advise
57a07a525623ed07ff09db3c;Its cool....
57a07a525623ed07ff09db3d;Best of it's kind This is the best app to set wallpapers. I really really wish that it could be somehow updated :(
57a07a525623ed07ff09db3e;Gud one... Using nearly 2 yrs.. awesome one..
57a07a525623ed07ff09db3f;Nice needs more features
57a07a525623ed07ff09db40;Psr Shupar
57a07a545623ed07ff09db41;Driod maxx It doesn't seem to work at all with my Motorola droid maxx. I really love this app, is there anything yall can do?
57a07a545623ed07ff09db42;Nyc aap
57a07a545623ed07ff09db43;Good, but... The wallpaper changes almost every time I open and close an app. It's getting annoying because I don't want it to change.

57a07a565623ed07ff09db48;I like this aap
57a07a565623ed07ff09db49;One problem though I love this app. I have tried other wallpaper changing apps but this one is just perfect for me.... Well, almost... I don't understand why but it refuses to show up in my apps list. I have to really dig into my settings and systems to activate it. Can the developers do something about this issue, please?
57a07a595623ed07ff09db4a;Awesome I love this app. I currently have a moto x and it let's me set a picture for each screen I have including my lock screen. The only problem I have is that I can't find it in my app display but that's not an issue for me. Great app definitely deserves 5 stars.
57a07a595623ed07ff09db4b;Doesnt work Does not work on my note 3 neo...shows just one screen..is it working for 4.4.4 kitkat?
57a07a595623ed07ff09db4c;Superb Nice app

57a07a5c5623ed07ff09db51;Didn't work Tried for over an hour on my gs3 and it only ever stayed on one picture. Tried using all the workarounds messing with the transition stuff and nothing changed when I would swipe screens. Waste of time. -5 stars.
57a07a5c5623ed07ff09db52;Overall this is a lovely app! Everything is working fine. The options to decrease opacity and saturation are awesome! Can't find this on the other app. Well done!
57a07a5d5623ed07ff09db53;Works perfectly! Great for backgrounds
57a07a5d5623ed07ff09db54;transitions not working please fix this... the transitions is always fade.. the others are not working. Lenovo a536

57a07a6d5623ed07ff09db68;used to work.. on my exhibit.now it only shows one picture for each screen.its set up the same way.now using exhibit 2.
57a07a6f5623ed07ff09db69;Transition effect not work. ..on jellybean with Apex Launcher
57a07a6f5623ed07ff09db6a;New phone. Loved it on my old phone, but when I changed to Galaxy S III, picture won't change from screen to screen. Tried the workaround but doesn't help. :( I think I'm going to find a different app.
57a07a6f5623ed07ff09db6b;Does not work on my galaxy note 4
57a07a6f5623ed07ff09db6c;Great app Transition effect does not work. It just fades in and out regardless the setting.
57a07a725623ed07ff09db6d;Works fine mostly, but changes at super random intervals regardless of what setting I choose - MANY times a day rather than every 24 hours. Also I'd like to have the same photo on every screen but that option doesn't seem to exist. LG G3
57a07a725623ed07ff09db6e;Russ Doesn't work on my Samsung s4
57a07a725623ed07ff09db6f;Totally rocking!!! Love this app!! Just what I've been looking for!
57a07a725623ed07ff09db70;Yangshin29 Image
57a07a775623ed07ff09db71;Smooth graphics; negligible effect on battery. I installed this on HTC One M8 and use it to alternate my home screen wallpaper every ten seconds (which can be set to a shorter or longer interval based on preference). It is not possible, though, to set a separate image for each home screen on the M8, even when using specialised settings in the app. This is not a feature that I wanted to use, but I mention it so other M8 owners are aware that HTC Sense prevents access to this. This is not a defect of the app! Ty to the developer for a fantastic product!
57a07a775623ed07ff09db72;Good App I like this app alot however i can not get the lock screen setting to change please fix and will change the rating
57a07a775623ed07ff09db73;Exactly what I needed but... Where is the app icon? It does not show up in my app list.
57a07a7b5623ed07ff09db74;Stopped working! The only app out there that worked on my s4, changed wallpaper on double tap and showed entire picture, now stretches the image doesn't change it! So disappointed!
57a07a7b5623ed07ff09db75;Must have app Varying look for my Desktop
57a07a7b5623ed07ff09db76;Great Free App LOVE THIS. It's good and ad free.
57a07a7b5623ed07ff09db77;I love this app, but lately it's been wonky on lollipop, I run 3 screens + Google Now and the second screens bg keeps getting double Image. I used the workaround of ignore vertical movement since forever but Now it doesn't seem to work. The only half solution is forcing 5 screens and adding another two screens which i don't need.
57a07a7d5623ed07ff09db78;Here i am
57a07a7d5623ed07ff09db79;Wow Excellent #

57a07a835623ed07ff09db83;Great
57a07a835623ed07ff09db84;Amazing All I can ask for is for this live wallpaper to allow apps to access the current picture. This is for Action Launcher 3. It has a feature that matches elements of the launcher to the color of the wallpaper and it would be amazing if this wallpaper worked with it.
57a07a835623ed07ff09db85;Did not work for note 3
57a07a835623ed07ff09db86;Doesn't work on Nexus 7 2013
57a07a855623ed07ff09db87;Need some works for mostly and whole devices! Mine is galaxy Mega device. Need some work for using what they want and change whole pixs... but it show for just once pix and cannot change the pages? That's pretty sucks! Sorry, had to tell u to do your work inprovement in programming. U do good but need some works in somehow and usingyour head to figure some more like nerds does! Can u do that?
57a07a855623ed07ff09db88;best one ever... but I have problem settings single screen wallpaper.. it doesn't change when I slide... pleeeeaaasssseee fix..
57a07a855623ed07ff09db89;I love it bad It a shot
57a07a855623ed07ff09db8a;Very nice good Works smoothly
57a07a925623ed07ff09db8b;Absolute BS I've NEVER had a problem with this app before and now, I can't even choose a picture and have the option to set it or change the picture and if I am lucky enough to set the picture it for some reason automatically switches the picture I chose to something completely different. Please fix or I will have no choice but to uninstall!
57a07a955623ed07ff09db8c;Does what it says It is a fine app but it does crash a little. If you patch it then 5 stars.
57a07a955623ed07ff09db8d;Home Screen Wallpaper works, What about Lockscreen wallpaper? Awesome, Home screen wallpaper changes as advertised. I use it every day. From the settings I see "Use Lock screen settings" and "Lock Screen Settings". But it doesn't change lock screen wallpaper, at least that's what My understanding is about this setting. Developer(s): Any explanation on this issue?
57a07a955623ed07ff09db8e;Perfect Just what I was looking for and love how you select multiple folders. Thank you
57a07a955623ed07ff09db8f;Wow

57a07a975623ed07ff09db94;Works great EXCEPT transitions don't work. I just get a Fade Out/Fade In no matter what option I choose. Nova on 5.0.2
57a07a975623ed07ff09db95;Good So good
57a07a9a5623ed07ff09db96;Lovly Apps
57a07a9a5623ed07ff09db97;Doesn't work. This app use to work but stopped working and hasn't changed. Very irritating. I put all the screens with the pictures and then it just shows a black screen on each one. This app SUCKS NOW! DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
57a07a9a5623ed07ff09db98;Not working on droid turbo When selecting single picture from gallery will not display picture but will show when you select to show entire gallery
57a07aa15623ed07ff09db99;Awesome from the start From android 4.2 to 4.3 this app always awesome, in 4.4.4 i have minor problem when i lock the screen and unlock again the picture always back to first image in album im using 3 screen with 3 different album (xperia z) i hope there is fix for this problem
57a07aa15623ed07ff09db9a;Nice wee app Different wallpaper every few hours.keeps phone lookin different
57a07aa15623ed07ff09db9b;Awesome experience Thnx for such grt app. Least space required , no foolish updating..n last bt not least it gives u chnce to put many wallpapers

57a07aa35623ed07ff09db9d;Brilliant Easy to use, great app, works great
57a07aa35623ed07ff09db9e;I like so much Good
57a07aa35623ed07ff09db9f;Xperia p Its nice bt we can't set photos. Pls add this
57a07aa35623ed07ff09dba0;Awesome Great, I likes it!
57a07aa35623ed07ff09dba1;SR Aa
57a07aa35623ed07ff09dba2;Love it...
57a07aa65623ed07ff09dba3;Nice app I was ok with the default app in my phone. i really liked it's feature that displays multiple pictures at a time by putting them in different frames, changing randomly. Problem is that it can only display 100 images. 5 stars if you can add that option. Loved the reflection feature though.
57a07aa65623ed07ff09dba4;Not Working Not Working On Xperia Z Kitkat. Please Fix. It Says The The Picture In Unavailable.
57a07aa65623ed07ff09dba5;Doesnt all work Does not work in regard to having different picture per screen. Also takes long long time to call up the 'select picture from' sceeen.
57a07aac5623ed07ff09dba6;Great Awesome app except for one thing (i may just not see it) but i dont see a way to make it so every swipe to change the page doesnt also change the picture. Is there a way and im just not seeing it?
57a07aac5623ed07ff09dba7;LOVE this app - wish it supported Google Drive as a folder location Not only does this app intelligently and efficiently cache the downloaded images, each "page" of your device will have a different one (and they all rotate at the programmed interval). This was a pleasant surprise for me. Wishlist: -Settings shared across all devices on account. -Google Drive folders for pictures.
57a07aac5623ed07ff09dba8;Nice
57a07aac5623ed07ff09dba9;Cool Thanks
57a07aaf5623ed07ff09dbaa;Cant be better Would love if app come with pre loaded wallpaper packs such as scenery, marvel,dc racing, sports, celebrities,
57a07aaf5623ed07ff09dbab;... Won't make a single pic for each screen like it's supposed to...
57a07aaf5623ed07ff09dbac;Not working on android lollipop Please fix this. Pictures are not loading in home screen.
57a07aaf5623ed07ff09dbad;Best I can find of it's kind. Used it on my Nexus 7 II and now I'm putting it on my One plus One. It does what I was looking for and doesn't affect the battery. Great app.
57a07ab25623ed07ff09dbae;It used to work Not so much anymore, maybe i have to many images (2010) for it to read the folder
57a07ab25623ed07ff09dbaf;Works... Except I can't seem to get the background color to stay black. Pictures still have random color background even though it's set to custom color. UI also isn't very intuitive, and there is no way to see the pictures when your picking what you want to use, you can only see the file names. Makes it hard when your phone camera issues a date and number as the file name.

57a07abd5623ed07ff09dbb1;ralph9250 I was very disappointed. I had a old Samsung Infuse and the application worked great. I had 3000+ pictures and they rotated between the 7 screens. A different picture on each screen. I had that phone for almost 3 years. This year I treated myself for Christmas and bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I am so disappointed because I cannot get the application to switch pictures when I change screens. I read in your report that this seems to be a problem with the Galaxy S series. FIX IT!
57a07abd5623ed07ff09dbb2;Awesome Yeah!!
57a07abd5623ed07ff09dbb3;Whatever Waste of time.
57a07ac05623ed07ff09dbb4;Toil
57a07ac05623ed07ff09dbb5;Works great The app had a good amount of effects and feature. Although it does have the problem where it only show one wallpaper on very rare occasions on nova launcher. It could use a better looking UI but that's nothing to deduct a star for. Using a Nexus 7 (2013) and Nexus 6 with Nova Launcher.
57a07ac05623ed07ff09dbb6;Awesome! Does what I want it to do.
57a07ac05623ed07ff09dbb7;must have superb.... easily handle tiny tool
57a07ac05623ed07ff09dbb8;Does not work
57a07ac35623ed07ff09dbb9;Buggy I get "Picture is unavailable. Need to setup or reload". Not working like it used to do
57a07ac35623ed07ff09dbba;Cool app works nicely.
57a07ac35623ed07ff09dbbb;It's not working. Got the Samsung Galaxy s5, now i can't get this app to work. its installed but won't show up on apps list. S5 doesn't seem to allow multiple wallpaper, so i only see one. that I setup while the app worked.
57a07ac35623ed07ff09dbbc;I like it app superb
57a07ac35623ed07ff09dbbd;Amazing Very perfect
57a07ac65623ed07ff09dbbe;Itzzz good
57a07ac65623ed07ff09dbbf;After updating it... my double click to change wallpaper is not working.... plz help me over this
57a07ac65623ed07ff09dbc0;All app in the top app It's app every used time
57a07ac65623ed07ff09dbc1;Pls download it for me
57a07ac65623ed07ff09dbc2;1 star for now Please make it work with the Note Edge, not working at all. I will give u 5 stars because I have used it before, but [please fix.
57a07ac85623ed07ff09dbc3;RAM Sucker This tiny app reduces my over 500 mb RAM to below 200. Deleting.
57a07ac85623ed07ff09dbc4;Doesn't work Doesn't work at all on LG g3
57a07ac85623ed07ff09dbc5;Best app Lovely app. Up to the mark. Any further improvements would be appreciated. I scale this app 10/10.
57a07ac85623ed07ff09dbc6;It used to be cool It only works on my old devices now. All my new ones are on Lollipop and that might be the problem
57a07ac85623ed07ff09dbc7;Nice Leeeeeelu
57a07ace5623ed07ff09dbc8;Does as it says, but not well To get a single picture to work correctly, you have to manually navigate (using an installed file explorer) to where that picture is located instead of using the built in selection. It also will not let you set the position for wallpapers larger than your display, and there isn't a setting to enable the "moving background" that is standard on Android for normal wallpapers. Many of the transitions do not work; many of them occurred even when moving between different pages of my home screen that had the same settings. Crossfade didn't work when unlocking my phone. The wallpaper faded to black and then faded the new wallpaper in. This would probably be acceptable if the animation was in any way smooth. In summary, this app has some neat features that "work," but some of them don't work and the ones that do never seem to work well. Didn't use it long enough to see if it impacts battery life. Nexus 5/Lollipop
57a07ace5623ed07ff09dbc9;Super Super
57a07ace5623ed07ff09dbca;Awesome
57a07ad05623ed07ff09dbcb;Boss Vijaybaskar15692
57a07ad05623ed07ff09dbcc;Works great I've used it on every smartphone I've had and love this app
57a07ad05623ed07ff09dbcd;Good concept Waiting for more features.....
57a07ad05623ed07ff09dbce;One of my favourites Where'd this app go? It was one of my favourites & I can't install it onto my new phone.
57a07ad05623ed07ff09dbcf;Good Good
57a07ad35623ed07ff09dbd0;Evergreen apps Its so awesome. I have no word to explain
57a07ad35623ed07ff09dbd1;I like it so beautiful app
57a07ad35623ed07ff09dbd2;Good app, looks great
57a07ad35623ed07ff09dbd3;An oldie but a goodie A different background for each home screen. Double tap to update pics. Genius! And it even works on Lollipop.
57a07ad35623ed07ff09dbd4;Won't show as app in app drawer Keep having to open this app from the Google store. Does not show up in Nova as an app
57a07ad55623ed07ff09dbd5;Doesn't work Won't let me choose a picture. "picture not available". Reset data a couple times, can't do anything.
57a07ad55623ed07ff09dbd6;Multi pics True
57a07ad55623ed07ff09dbd7;Partly works All screens change not just screens you choose.
57a07ad55623ed07ff09dbd8;Doesn't show my pictures.
57a07ad55623ed07ff09dbd9;Nice It's cool app
57a07ae15623ed07ff09dbda;Nicee... But add some new effects. Plz add working lockscreen settings.
57a07ae15623ed07ff09dbdb;Love it! I was worried when I came off of stock g3 (which has this feature built in) to aosp because I didn't want to loose this. Even though this app hasn't seen an update on almost two years, it works flawlessly and is way smoother than the others I've tried. Hey, if it ain't broke...
57a07ae75623ed07ff09dbdc;Works just fine for me!!
57a07ae75623ed07ff09dbdd;Doesn't even work I used to have this on an old phone and it worked great. But it won't work on my standard Lucid 3. It won't let me use any pictures and says error, need to reload or some crap. Once it's fixed, I'll give it its five stars.
57a07ae75623ed07ff09dbde;Used to be good I've tried a few other apps like this and always go back to this one. I love the double tap to change picture option, the way you can have your main screen bright and have other pages dim (making apps icons and text easier to see) but none of this works anymore and its very buggy and hard to use. Avoid! UNINTALLING
57a07aea5623ed07ff09dbdf;Nice app Its superb for setting wallpaper without cropping nd edit actual photo on screen... Really good.
57a07aea5623ed07ff09dbe0;Awesome app!! I'm using it for past 3 years.. Good in my old Xperia x8 and new z1.. Just love it
57a07aea5623ed07ff09dbe1;‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øà
57a07aea5623ed07ff09dbe2;Doesn't work with Galaxy S4 on Android 4.4.4. :-(
57a07aea5623ed07ff09dbe3;Installed twice Still sucks
57a07aec5623ed07ff09dbe4;Worthless
57a07aec5623ed07ff09dbe5;Gud.
57a07aec5623ed07ff09dbe6;Great app Nice transitions.
57a07aec5623ed07ff09dbe7;Update guyz... Doesn't work with android 2.3.5 ...please vuyz do something...
57a07aec5623ed07ff09dbe8;Best live wallpaper ever
57a07aec5623ed07ff09dbe9;So good Use all
57a07aef5623ed07ff09dbea;Not work htc m8 Kinda lame, also had previously purchased full version and now they want to charge me again on new phone. Still not working with HTC 1 M8 11/13/04
57a07aef5623ed07ff09dbeb;Needs work around for HTC sensation
57a07aef5623ed07ff09dbec;TEDYBR DIDNT DO WHAT I WANTED BUT I LIKE THAT U CAN CHOOSE MORE THAN ONE FOLDER AND CHANGE BACKGROUND COLORS. WOULD HAVE GAVE FIVE BUT DOES NOT LET ME DO THE DIFFERENT PIC DIFFERENT SCREEN Option .......REVIEW UPDATE App is working great now LOVE IT THAT'S...!
57a07af35623ed07ff09dbed;It used to be my favorite LWP, BUT I used to love this app, BUT at some point it changed and the pics no longer with the screen. Workarounds don't work. Fix it and I would gladly give 5 stars. Using galaxy s3. Disappointed
57a07af35623ed07ff09dbee;Does one thing and does it great‚Ä¶ It's vital part of my app deck.
57a07af35623ed07ff09dbef;Just love it It's great I Love it use it everyday . It is perfect
57a07af35623ed07ff09dbf0;very good app...if you are bored of locking at same wall screen
57a07b025623ed07ff09dbf1;Great game, well balanced and extremely fun, character to character, warrior is tankier so it's easy to get started, mage has good ranged attacks so it balances out, rogue doesn't have a very high bonus and huntress is a bit squishy, this might be by design but it's a bit annoying being defeated by a single gnoll on level 2
57a07b025623ed07ff09dbf2;Every time its different Very cool. Doesn't get old. Great developer support.
57a07b025623ed07ff09dbf3;This is probably one of the best mobile RPGs there are It can be kind of confusing at first but after you get the hang of it it's absolutely wonderful. The game has plenty of interesting possibilities for characters and items that allows it to have a lot of replay value. Everyone is unique and interesting and you never feel like anyone is more powerful than the next, it is always challenging.
57a07b035623ed07ff09dbf4;Amazing Purely amazing game with fasnating aspects and the fact it's free is just wonderful. Extremely hard but just awesome, recommended to try
57a07b035623ed07ff09dbf5;Hours of fun! User friendly dungeon adventure game. Fun and challenging!
57a07b035623ed07ff09dbf6;Heck ya Awesome.
57a07b035623ed07ff09dbf7;It is so simple It is so simple that there is loads of loot and loads of fun
57a07b065623ed07ff09dbf8;Amazing Whatever it offers, it delivers. As says the dev, it's a roguelike with a harsh survival and you will die many times but you want regret playing it.
57a07b065623ed07ff09dbf9;Too hard Where the hell is the hunger bar?
57a07b065623ed07ff09dbfa;A fun,addictive game. But, the gameplay is too short. If you encounter a wraith, all you see is 'wraith evaded you!' when you try and hit it. The game is beatifull and mystical, but as soon as you find something cool, like an enchanted battleaxe, potion,ect, don't expect to have it for long. But the game is free, and the only purchase is a donation, unlike most apps that pressure you into buying powerups, ect with money.
57a07b075623ed07ff09dbfb;Ok Go to YouTube and type Cade Osborn and watch him I'm his friend plz!!!
57a07b075623ed07ff09dbfc;Not a lot of data needed
57a07b075623ed07ff09dbfd;Best game ever I love it it's the best game ever you should get it
57a07b075623ed07ff09dbfe;Love it but needs help The huntress is way too hard to unlock to be the weakest character in the game. I feel cheated, working so hard to get it.
57a07b075623ed07ff09dbff;Crap 1 life if u die game entirely resets
57a07b095623ed07ff09dc00;Amazing It is such a good game and takes hardly any space on my phone and does not need wifi so i can play it when ever. The random generation of the map makes it more fun and unpredictable. Love it.
57a07b095623ed07ff09dc01;Fun time waster I hate this game but its very addicting. Ive played atleast 50 times and only reached lvl 6 once. Very frustrating but it keeps sucking me back in
57a07b095623ed07ff09dc02;An amazingly great way to spend time, the difficulty makes you determined to win. The only thing it could use now is online multiplayer.
57a07b095623ed07ff09dc03;It's fun but..... I would like more than one life before game over.
57a07b0c5623ed07ff09dc04;No ads Everybody stop complaining, learn what a rogue-like is and learn to play the game, the mechanics are complex but you need to learn them
57a07b0c5623ed07ff09dc05;Simply entertainment Wonderful game. I am interrupted in 5 minute increments daily. I can play this in my down time, yet drop it instantly and come back to it. Game is turn based, so I don't have to worry about my character. Yes it's extremely hard and I die often. I rarely get a character past level 5. I love it. Each new game is literally new, and who knows what will happen? I have come up empty and died on the first level, but I've also found awesome items early on and gone on to win the game.
57a07b0c5623ed07ff09dc06;999999999999999999999999 Played on laptop, it was the BOMB AND NOW ITS ON PHONES AND TABLETTTTTTTSSSSSSSS9999999999999999998999999999999
57a07b0e5623ed07ff09dc07;best mobile game Pixel dungeon has managed to be the only game that has remained on my phone without getting deleted. It's challenging enough that it keeps you interested and motivated enough to keep playing. Yes, it can sometimes be overly frustrating, but this is part of what makes it such a great game in my opinion. I can't rate this highly enough.
57a07b0e5623ed07ff09dc08;Make it multiplayer
57a07b0e5623ed07ff09dc09;Great This is a great game. I would pay money for it if it was on console or pc for sure.
57a07b0e5623ed07ff09dc0a;I love it... It's well made and it's quite fun. It's good for time consumption.
57a07b0f5623ed07ff09dc0b;Difficult! An entertaining and simple game! It also provides a great challenge. Every game you play is randomly generated, which gives it quite a twist too.
57a07b0f5623ed07ff09dc0c;Great game Nice, old school game that is pretty hard. I seem to run out of food too often (unless I get to the store). One minor bug: about 10% of the time the wand maker's target is in a locked room with no key. Also, making the game more difficult at night just means I don't play when I have the best availability.
57a07b0f5623ed07ff09dc0d;Simply amazing
57a07b0f5623ed07ff09dc0e;Fantastic! Nothing beat's the original
57a07b125623ed07ff09dc0f;Found a bug :) If you jump down almost dead, burning, into chasm you will survive and no monsters will attack you. DEVELOPERS!! P.S if you take a dew wial drop- you will "respawn" :)
57a07b125623ed07ff09dc10;Addictive I'm always play it every single time, it is good game, not the best, and there some enemies that really strong(not the boss) piranha and wraith, I hate those enemies
57a07b125623ed07ff09dc11;My favorite game Seriously. I have a problem...
57a07b155623ed07ff09dc12;The quintessential Rouge Dungeon This is by far the most impressive game of the genre I have ever had the honor of playing. Constant updates and consistent bug checking, as well as a dedicated community of earnest players help this game soar to the top of my download list every single time! Keep up the great work guys!
57a07b155623ed07ff09dc13;Tons of fun. Pretty hard, with a lot of replayability. Spent hundreds of hours on it, and cherished each victory like my first one.
57a07b155623ed07ff09dc14;nice game reminds me of being terrible at old rpgs :^)
57a07b175623ed07ff09dc15;Hmmm Huntress should NOT lose her Boomerang on death. Makes no sense since that is the main feature for that class. Also if you have an Ankh, why do you lose all your bags & equipment upon dying? Ankh should auto-rez you like the Dew Vial filling upon reaching 0 Health or let you pick up your old equip from your corpse since its still the same run. Makes having an Ankh almost useless if you have to build up your entire BP again with only 25 levels. Having a soft save ability at interval bosses would be nice also
57a07b175623ed07ff09dc16;Love it "BUT I REALLY HATE MIMIC"
57a07b175623ed07ff09dc17;Noice
57a07b195623ed07ff09dc18;Was great The weapon degredation makes it impossible to play honestly it was hard before but now that all my equipment breaks in 2 or 3 floors its impossible
57a07b1d5623ed07ff09dc19;Best game for Android Best game for Android, very difficult, very rewarding. After beating it 4(5) times I can say that random traps need to be removed, as a rng chance you take heavy damage by walking is just retarded. Maybe hide the traps in the trap rooms. Also more variety and difference between the different rooms and enemy's would be great. Thanks devs
57a07b1d5623ed07ff09dc1a;I love PD! Welcome to pixle dungeon an amazing game which can keep you busy for hours. I'm not going to spoil the game if your new but I'll just say, SPOILER WARNING the sacrificial flame (or whatever that is) is an awesome feature, probably my favorite so far! Now that's out of the way, please if your reading this watabow (I can't remember your name ever sorry!) Here's something all of my friends want out of pixle dungeon, 1.Thirst. 2.a new class 3. Infinite dungeon 4.more potions/scrolls. Thank you for a good game
57a07b1f5623ed07ff09dc1b;Awesome Challenging, rewarding, full, free game with no ads.
57a07b1f5623ed07ff09dc1c;I can't live with these garbage controls üò£
57a07b1f5623ed07ff09dc1d;Not bad! Its really fun! Just the retro look, and the RPG feeling is pretty cool.
57a07b1f5623ed07ff09dc1e;Good roguelike
57a07b1f5623ed07ff09dc1f;LOVE U GUYS Hey Developers:) Ive been playing this game for a very long time and only noticed that I havent reviewed it yet. I love the art and difficulty of this game. I just have 2 questions. WHENS THE NEXT UPDATE? And what does tge sacrificial fire do üî•?
57a07b225623ed07ff09dc20;Amazing amazing amazing Amazing amazing amazing
57a07b225623ed07ff09dc21;well balanced and ruthless! it's got the proper difficulty of a classic roguelike with a delicious modern twist. the music is perfect. I haven't made it past the ooze yet so im not sure if it's just the one track but after a little over an hour im not sick of the loop yet. very attractive graphics. simple yet incredibly satisfying. any classic roguelike fan would get a kick out of this. keep up the good work man!
57a07b225623ed07ff09dc22;I hated it I hated this game cause it is a horrible game that was hard for me to control
57a07b245623ed07ff09dc23;Awesome game, but.. I love the game, its simple, cool, and it kills time anywhere, I just wish it was available on windows phones (my phone is wp8.1 and tablet is android)
57a07b245623ed07ff09dc24;Awesome Get this game
57a07b245623ed07ff09dc25;Best This game is meme-tastic
57a07b245623ed07ff09dc26;Where are you now, Devs?
57a07b245623ed07ff09dc27;Minor issues I cant tap it only zooms until you reset the game. And pls nerf the gripping trap. Freaking thing suddenly kills you without the damage being shown.
57a07b275623ed07ff09dc28;Holiday you can't respawn
57a07b275623ed07ff09dc29;Yyy Ooo
57a07b275623ed07ff09dc2a;Best rogue game
57a07b275623ed07ff09dc2b;It's okay but many problems.. It's a good game, but the mobs can easily kill you if you don't get the right gear in lvl 1, it's impossible to get through the caves because the gnoll brutes will one shot you, even with +4 plate armor. (Is supposed to absorb up to 30 points but obviously doesn't ) and then there's the goo which my gf has never gotten past because of its rapid enrage.
57a07b2c5623ed07ff09dc2c;Words from an old veteran I have been playing for years and finished this game 4 times and instead of luck,this game is about strategis and actual skill as it tellsyou to manage your rations,keeping good item and removing bad ones etc...
57a07b2c5623ed07ff09dc2d;Get rid of broken items I love this game, been playing for years....please change this new broken items thing. I hate it. I am done playing Because i am now forced to pick an item to super level. Everyrhing else i find won't last long enough ro help me.
57a07b2c5623ed07ff09dc2e;Best game Ever! It works again :) This is the only game that i really enjoy playing.
57a07b2c5623ed07ff09dc2f;No saved game data when char is dead as meat. Difficult.
57a07b325623ed07ff09dc30;I love it I like to use on the toilet
57a07b325623ed07ff09dc31;rogue what?! rouge can't steal from shop and where is the cloak of invisibility? those are the best thing about rogue :(
57a07b325623ed07ff09dc32;Great time waster Hey guys cool game my only feedbacks would be maybe include an autoflee for when you locked in a heave hitting fight where the oponent is taking no damage or maybe smoke grenades to acheive the same effect the other idea is perhaps have the option of the stat bars being percentages or a numerical value great game tho i gunna keep playing
57a07b325623ed07ff09dc33;Way too hard
57a07b335623ed07ff09dc34;Coo killer I love it!!
57a07b335623ed07ff09dc35;no save points I gave it 4 because I reeeeaaaaallllly like this game. but I'm Uninstaller it cause you can't save your progress. and there is nothing more frustrating that getting to level 5 and having to start over cause a crab killed you with one hit. bye.
57a07b335623ed07ff09dc36;Good Time Waster! Too much time ;-)
57a07b335623ed07ff09dc37;One of the best roguelike games
57a07b365623ed07ff09dc38;Fun Extremely fun and challenging! Even though I keep dying at bosses extremely fun and addicting, would recommend others to download and play
57a07b365623ed07ff09dc39;Possibly the best Rogue-like game ever This game is the best of any rogue-like game, very hard, all strategy, infinitely playable so simple but so complex at the same time. A must play for anyone who loves RPG games but have patience! You won't even beat the first boss without dying 20+ times first, its just the nature of the game. Easily a 5 star rating EDIT: still the greatest game I've played on my phone. Beaten two characters, two to go. The degradation feature really sucks though, I wish it was optional.
57a07b385623ed07ff09dc3a;Why This game is very fun challenging and addicting but my biggest problem is that the dodging percentage like a single mimic can kill u from full health because of this Stat please fix it
57a07b385623ed07ff09dc3b;Well made I think the huntress is slightly underpowered.
57a07b385623ed07ff09dc3c;Mage When i the mage's wand it crashes please fix
57a07b385623ed07ff09dc3d;Best game ever Like none other ive played befor
57a07b3c5623ed07ff09dc3e;Addictive, but a little frustrating. I enjoy challenging RPG/Adventure games very much. But the fact that food is very important, yet VERY scarse, is a little disappointing. You can't rest when your "starving", therefore you can't replenish your health. Dying to a simple rat because you didn't have a biscuit to eat is annoying. Increase the random food generator and I'd give it 5 stars.
57a07b3c5623ed07ff09dc3f;'Pixelated crack' - this thing will drive you insane on occasion but it's a great puzzle to work through. Pay attention, use resources well and there's a much better chance of progressing. It's a truly skill-based game.
57a07b3c5623ed07ff09dc40;Shop? It said that there is a shop but I can't seem to find it plz tell me where it is and I will rate 5 stars
57a07b3e5623ed07ff09dc41;Best Dungeon Game!!!... I love it But Can U make Ur Game Available For Iphone cuz I want to download in my iphone.And If U will Make The Game Free like it is in android and I will give u 5 stars
57a07b3e5623ed07ff09dc42;AWESOME I like the gameplay and have been playing it for hours after downloading it. it is really addictive. hope there will be more items in next update :)
57a07b3e5623ed07ff09dc43;Great for otakus If you like fire emblem, sword art online ect.
57a07b425623ed07ff09dc44;A love/hate relationship. This game is a frustratingly-unfair mobile masterpiece. One wrong turn in this deadly dungeon, you'll find yourself back at square one, all knowledge of potion effects lost: meaning you have to try them and probably set yourself on fire. It's a vicious cycle. That been said, the mechanics are superb for a mobile platform. "Just one more try" is something you'll probably be muttering a lot. Download PD and get ready to hate yourself, in a... good way?
57a07b425623ed07ff09dc45;Worth Fun, open source, nice graphics and UI, remains one of the top games on my phone
57a07b425623ed07ff09dc46;Enjoyable but... ...hard!!
57a07b445623ed07ff09dc47;This is an awesome game! Epic rogue-like and rpg game. Uses up hardly any space on my phone so it's great. Really entertaining, you can spend hours playing it. I have been enjoying this game so far and that's why I give it a 5 star rating
57a07b445623ed07ff09dc48;Amazingly Fun and Challenging Game! If you like roguelikes then this game is a must-have for you. There are a ton of interlocking mechanics that make this game very unique. As the description states, this game is very difficult and luck-based. I have never won a single run yet although I've played over 100 games; I barely made it to the final boss once on my best run. To succeed in Pixel Dungeon you'll need a decent understanding of the game's mechanics, good resource management, and luck. All in all, this game is amazing! Can only recommend!
57a07b465623ed07ff09dc49;I love this Zelda - like game, especially since its free and doesn't require Wi-Fi!
57a07b465623ed07ff09dc4a;10/10 its so challenging, so fun and at the same time it's frustrating. i love this game. one of the best rouge like games ever keep adding contents please :)
57a07b465623ed07ff09dc4b;Fun and Challenging I am having fun but at the same time getting mad because it is challenging
57a07b465623ed07ff09dc4c;Pixel dungeon Wow, best roguelike I have ever played. It's very, very simple yet awesome.
57a07b495623ed07ff09dc4d;Some good and some bad Good: The game is very true to the rougelike genre and challenging, prepare for several doomed first attempts and to learn from your mistakes in order to progress. Random dungeon generation makes repeat plays fresh and is very repayable. Bad: The randomness of weapon/armor drops make it difficult to get past some of the early stages, especially if the ghost side quest provides minimal value. Deterioration is a pain and serves no real point other than to provide another way to screw over late game players.
57a07b495623ed07ff09dc4e;This game is life consuming! Yes, you COULD put it down any time, theoretically. But do you have enough will power? PS; play it after midnight. Game gets much more interesting.
57a07b4b5623ed07ff09dc4f;Item degradation Normally I would consider this a five star game, however, that was before the item degradation was introduced. Enemies are infinite, while ways to repair your items are not. And I'm sure you all know that the game is enough of a challenge without item breakdown. Take away item degradation and this is a five star game.
57a07b4b5623ed07ff09dc50;Needs a revive feature Can't I keep the coins and use them to revive myself. Please!
57a07b4b5623ed07ff09dc51;Great time killer! ‚ù§‚ù§üíôüíô This game is so fun, yet rage worthy. It's so easy to kill time with. Waiting for someone to meet up with you? Play this game! I give it 800 stars out of 10
57a07b4e5623ed07ff09dc52;I played it.Like it.Rate it I have played this game about.. .2 years ago.. The Warrior was good enough for me yet.And The Mage.. .was rated for 2 stars.And The A a.. I don't remember much to him.. .but I give it 1stars.Everyone,Plz rate this game for 5 stars.You know what,This game is PixelCool.And.. I uninstall it.
57a07b4e5623ed07ff09dc53;IT WAS A AWESOME GAME!!!üòÜüòÜüòÜ IT IS AWESOMEüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
57a07b4e5623ed07ff09dc54;Good game Though the game is very hard
57a07b4e5623ed07ff09dc55;I love it The game has simple graphics,great gameplay,and hours of fun as you try and survive many unique monsters and traps
57a07b515623ed07ff09dc56;Amazing! Addictive! Fun! This game is fantastic, but challenging at times. It's really only one of the games that I've kept.
57a07b515623ed07ff09dc57;This game has a lot of fun 3 mb Worst game on earth
57a07b515623ed07ff09dc58;I love the simple graphics and the dungeon crawler game play, even if it is difficult.
57a07b515623ed07ff09dc59;Pretty good Game seems to be poorly balanced though, warrior is good but the rest of the classes are pretty useless which is a shame b because I prefer to play a rogue or mage... Warrior is too much tank and spank to be fun... Was pretty dissapointed when I finally got the huntress...
57a07b525623ed07ff09dc5a;Addicting as crap!!!!!!!! This is THE best and most creative dungeon crawler in every existence ever!!!!!!! ‚ò∫üòÄüòç
57a07b525623ed07ff09dc5b;Very good game This is one of the best RPGs in dah world. This RPG changed my life and it's ad free
57a07b525623ed07ff09dc5c;Good but ridiculously unfair... The game is rather hard due to the fact you starve WAYY TOO QUICKLY
57a07b525623ed07ff09dc5d;Dark Souls pixel addition But with perma-death
57a07b525623ed07ff09dc5e;Dying simulator
57a07b545623ed07ff09dc5f;Great roguelike game
57a07b545623ed07ff09dc60;Cannot save progress The overall gameplay is amazing but being unable to save progress is seriously frustrating. Because when you die, you have to start all over again. What a shame! Having no option to save does not make this game more challenging for me, it only makes it more ennoying and makes me want to throw your game away and play another.
57a07b545623ed07ff09dc61;Nice game Nice game
57a07b565623ed07ff09dc62;Astounding! One of my favorite rogue-likes of all time! Great gameplay, lots of different scenarios, no dungeon is ever the same! Great graphics! All you rogue-like fans, this game is a must have! Keep up the good work on this excellent game!
57a07b565623ed07ff09dc63;I loved the game!!!! This game is awesome, and HARD. And fun!
57a07b565623ed07ff09dc64;Addictive I've tried other remixes and mods to this game but nothing beats the original. No matter what I just can't stop playing. Pls add more items though
57a07b565623ed07ff09dc65;Maravilhoso! Jogo excelente!
57a07b5b5623ed07ff09dc66;This game is great! The only thing that I have against this game is that it cost money on other phones.
57a07b5b5623ed07ff09dc67;Eh... let's die a bunch Here a bag of random. Hope you don't starve to death, but man what a game without ads. Oh and open source. Slow clapped to five stars.
57a07b5b5623ed07ff09dc68;Worse than older versions More the game was updated, worse the quality was. There were so many bugs that were not exist in older versions, such as : keys don't generate, killing the first boss made you have achievements such as Amulet of Yendor obtained, last boss killed, and unlocking challenges and huntress. I honestly say that the remixes of this game are better.
57a07b5f5623ed07ff09dc69;I can't survive long, but I'm fairly sure that's just me being bad at games more than anything Good job, it's a great game and a nice blast from the past
57a07b5f5623ed07ff09dc6a;It is a fun game. It is a GREAT game, but I feel like more should be done with it. You have minimal quick health options, and, unless you have a scroll of identify on hand, you just have to take your chances with the potions. Yes, you can heal with food, but WHAT SELF-RESPECTING PLAYER WOULD USE THEIR FOOD RATIONS TO HEAL?! Sorry I just get kind of sensitive to this kind of thing. I guess what I'm saying is: It is a great game, but it feels incomplete.
57a07b5f5623ed07ff09dc6b;Awesome game It is a simple retro game you can play on he go! I know I love it!
57a07b625623ed07ff09dc6c;Crap It's way to hard on the 3rd floor
57a07b625623ed07ff09dc6d;Awesome Maybe do a YouTube Video on it maybe. I'll thing about it
57a07b625623ed07ff09dc6e;I'm probably biased. I love the original Brogue. Guess I should have expected to be disappointed by a mobile remake. Also, for those of you curious, I am in fact 18 years old, so don't give up on my generation yet.
57a07b625623ed07ff09dc6f;Amazing reviews and it looks a lot like terraria so this the type of game I've been waiting for PS. I wrote the description on the title sorryüòî
57a07b635623ed07ff09dc70;Mehh Game is fair for style. Not my favorite however. Won't be picking it up for a few hours after DL.
57a07b635623ed07ff09dc71;Perfect mobile design This is what a well-designed game looks like. No microtransactions, no ads, clean interface, the game exits cleanly and doesn't pester you with notifications. To top it off, it's actually a fun brogue-esque roguelike! I donated - you gotta support responsible and skilled devs like this.
57a07b635623ed07ff09dc72;It has made me late for work Challenging and well-designed
57a07b665623ed07ff09dc73;Difficulty. I can be turned off by frustrating games, but this game has the perfect mixture of luck and skill, and you really feel a sense of accomplishment over even tiny victories. I've tried the enhanced versions, but I like the level of complexity where it's at with the original.
57a07b665623ed07ff09dc74;!,, Borring !
57a07b665623ed07ff09dc75;Use the scroll of wipe out when you get to a merchant and steal all his things
57a07b665623ed07ff09dc76;high difficulty add more chests , weapons , and food
57a07b685623ed07ff09dc77;I got the amulet and made it out! EDIT: This is the original, and for that it has to be applauded. However, there are versions of this game on the Play Store that kick this original version's arse. Sorry to say it but it's true. Furthermore, item degradation is one of the biggest mistakes the dev has made with this game through the updates. [[Phew! So it IS possible. I was starting to wonder. Best game ever.]]
57a07b685623ed07ff09dc78;Freaking incredible. Love it soon much. Great time passer. It will make you think and it is such a challenge but manageable. It's like a dungeon version of dark souls. You die so much but you always come back for more. Please make another with a story mode or something please. You creators have such a great thing going here.
57a07b685623ed07ff09dc79;Yay
57a07b6a5623ed07ff09dc7a;Very Cool! Please add more characters üòÜ
57a07b6a5623ed07ff09dc7b;Fantastic example of a good mobile game No bullshit pay wall, a single micro transaction which is an entirely different character. Oh and did I mention it's amazing for toilet play.
57a07b6a5623ed07ff09dc7c;pretty good hard tho
57a07b6a5623ed07ff09dc7d;BLAST FROM THE PAST! I have never found myself so hooked on a mobile game. Usually I play PC. This is a terrific homage to the Roguelikes from the 90s! Super replayable!
57a07b6c5623ed07ff09dc7e;Easy five stars.. hard game but possible All i can say is it deserves 5‚òÜ it has the rpg atmosphere to it.. and the adventure/survival type that is really great... the dificult thing is food and enemies.. first level is hard specially if you were unlucky with items and my recent achievement is that i reached level 2-9 where you will find the 2nd boss a ninja-looking-punk that throws shurikens and always hits you.. and that is where ive died..
57a07b6c5623ed07ff09dc7f;So fun I already been playing this game from last year so much fun :D
57a07b705623ed07ff09dc80;Is there anything past level 4? I'm only ever able to get to level 4 because food is so scarce that I'm starving every 4 seconds which disables my ability to sleep and heal, so the overwhelming hordes of overpowered enemies come and destroy me. I've been able to collect 400+ gold, but I have yet to come across the shop. TL:DR, the hunger mechanic was an awful feature to include.
57a07b705623ed07ff09dc81;One of the best games I've ever played
57a07b705623ed07ff09dc82;Pixel-Dark soul Game really hard and bosses lots harder on way, with pretty satisfied ending
57a07b705623ed07ff09dc83;Cool but... I hope you know people are stealing your game right?
57a07b715623ed07ff09dc84;Amazing It is really great, but also hard
57a07b715623ed07ff09dc85;Pixel Dungeon is great. Hilariously fun! Also great.
57a07b715623ed07ff09dc86;It's really good You should add pvp and coop features for online help also maybe a trading interface
57a07b715623ed07ff09dc87;Great But Has Problems The hunger needs serious nerfing when you wear heavy armour. I was wearing upgraded chainmail and I was starving every six moves or so and it lead to my downfall by skeletons.
57a07b745623ed07ff09dc88;The good and the bad The good part about the game is the layout of it. The bad part is the gameplay, I can't stop dying on floor 2 or 3.
57a07b745623ed07ff09dc89;Insane difficulty level I like this game a lot, love the rogue like idea. However, game most of the time is unplayable because of insane difficulty level. So far I got to fifth level of dungeon, being killed dozens of times in the process. It's just too difficult.
57a07b745623ed07ff09dc8a;great game very fun and challenging ... just one thing I noticed... this game doesn't save like the rest.... that would make things much smoother for me.... I can't even make it off of floor 3 with good stuff
57a07b745623ed07ff09dc8b;Very good game. This game was good enough to make me donate money.
57a07b785623ed07ff09dc8c;Great Prefect game for a phone with little storage, alot of fun and challenge packed into a few megs
57a07b785623ed07ff09dc8d;Great game Good
57a07b785623ed07ff09dc8e;Poop
57a07b785623ed07ff09dc8f;This game sucks. There is no way to stay alive and no real tutorial to tell you what the heck you are supposed to do
57a07b785623ed07ff09dc90;Addictive I love this game and can't stop playing it!
57a07b7b5623ed07ff09dc91;Not worth the frustration. This game is infuriatingly hard, to the point where it's not even fun anymore. The graphics are nice and gameplay is smooth, which is the only reason this is getting two stars from me. It needs a save or checkpoint system really badly. Oh, and if you play at night - which I usually do - the game is EVEN HARDER. The lowest I was able to get is 4, so you be the judge of that.
57a07b7b5623ed07ff09dc92;I'm impressed Excellent graphics, spectacular gameplay, even the music is great! It has a eerie feel to it that keeps you wondering what's next? I'm amazed that such a great game doesn't have more downloads! Encore! Haha, it's made even more challenging by the fact that, if you die it's game over. The lack of save is a surprising twist, that makes you even more determined to win!
57a07b7e5623ed07ff09dc93;A perfect adaptation for mobile of roguelike games. Fun, challenging, with an excelent user interface and great gameplay. Do not expect it to be easy, specialy in your first runs, you need to adapt to the dinamics for example on how to identify things, the turn based actions, sourprise attacks, hunger, etc. But if you get to understand it (it is pretty easy), you will enjoy it a lot!
57a07b7e5623ed07ff09dc94;Hate starting from scratch Starting again from nothing is not fun
57a07b7e5623ed07ff09dc95;Very good game I really like the game, and how it plays. However I think that the bosses (mainly the goo) should be more balanced.
57a07b805623ed07ff09dc96;Fantastic This game is Hard, Skillful, and Luck-Based all at the same time. The makings of a perfect game. Would rate higher if I could.
57a07b805623ed07ff09dc97;Really amazing game Please i know you may be busy but make a 2.0 update!!!
57a07b805623ed07ff09dc98;It was OK but I can't get past a certain point
57a07b805623ed07ff09dc99;10/10 Perfect game, doesn't use push notifications, doesn't ask you to rate it doesn't have adds.
57a07b805623ed07ff09dc9a;Great game but... You get killed easily :-; but very addictive though ,or I'm just a noob .
57a07b835623ed07ff09dc9b;Great but really difficult! Love the whole no ads or iap in this game, thanks for that. Definitely my favourite game on the app store, been playing for over a year now and the new features are good. My only issue is playing at night, it's pretty much hard mode due to more creatures, would prefer if this was an option.
57a07b835623ed07ff09dc9c;It's ok First you starve way to fast and the enemies can kill you in a blink of an eye. Second there should be checkpoints if you die then instead of going back to the top you can head right to level 5 or something. Third, can we have some spells and scrolls at the beginning? Also more food on a level. Fourth decrease the enemies hit points and health. Would give five stars on update.
57a07b835623ed07ff09dc9d;I enjoyed it
57a07b865623ed07ff09dc9e;AMAZING! After playing it it was hard at first but it gets better and is a great game to try stratages
57a07b865623ed07ff09dc9f;Addictive & fun This game game is very addictive and fun. Easily put down at any time and resumed later, perfect while waiting for someone or while on the toilet. Best game on android you could download easily.
57a07b865623ed07ff09dca0;Ahnk is broken I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love to hate it. Mostly because I'm no good at rogue like games, and have a hard time getting past the Tengu, or even surviving long after that. If you haven't downloaded this game, do it now. To the dev: using the ahnk crashes my game and forces a new game. Please fix.
57a07b895623ed07ff09dca1;Awesome So much to do so you don't get bored playing it.
57a07b895623ed07ff09dca2;The f with the degradation, dude? Yeah dude, wth?
57a07b895623ed07ff09dca3;This game is everything I've ever wanted from an app, or even just a game in general. Love the old school feel. Those complaining about how difficult it is and the random assignment of item effects every time you start a session: it's not meant to be easy, you're not getting anything handed to you on a silver platter. I've recommended it to many friends since first installing and I'm recommending it to you too.
57a07b8c5623ed07ff09dca4;A Good Game, But Too Hard I liked the game at first, but I wish there were some difficulty controls. I consistently die on levels 1, 2, or three. Wraith and piranha are too strong, food is scarce and starvation kills quickly, and so forth. The inability to return to a saved game and the inability to control the difficulty level just sapped all the fun out of it for me. Constantly dying right away just makes the game more frustrating than fun. Too bad, because otherwise it was fun at first.
57a07b8c5623ed07ff09dca5;Amazing So much depth yet so easy to play. Brilliantly balanced. Very exciting, addictive and tense at times. Polished to the point of perfection. I donated twice
57a07b8e5623ed07ff09dca6;Cool but.. This game i cool and all but it needs more updates. It kinda bores me everytime i die there should be a checkpoint, i know it's roguelike but please, take this advice into consideration..
57a07b8e5623ed07ff09dca7;Best mobile roguelike Fun. Addictive. Challenging.
57a07b8e5623ed07ff09dca8;Love it So hard, so nice
57a07b8e5623ed07ff09dca9;One solid made game I think that there should be more games like this. It makes every round feel new and fresh by random level making. Keep up the good man!
57a07b905623ed07ff09dcaa;Epicness Best.roguelike.ever
57a07b905623ed07ff09dcab;I didnt like it, I'm unistaling right now. Pixel dungeon
57a07b905623ed07ff09dcac;Really good game with fantastic mechanics but it's honestly extremely difficult to beat the first boss, so much so that it seems impossible
57a07b905623ed07ff09dcad;Great time killer Amazing game! Simple yet fun. I'd you love rogue likes you will dig this.
57a07b945623ed07ff09dcae;Successful runs require patience, strategy, and LUCK. You will die often - keep playing, it's about the challenge! I have over 125 runs since downloading it a month ago and have not beaten it yet. At first I got frustrated when I died so much because I'd never played a roguelite, but I quickly developed a taste for it. It's very much about the journey :) Edit: 2 years later I still play this almost every day.
57a07b945623ed07ff09dcaf;It was fun Finnmark
57a07b945623ed07ff09dcb0;Great time killer! Well it kills time so bad and got addicted to it! Still trying to finish the game with rogue and huntress, hope bug fixes like missing key would be fixed soon also with the revive ankh, item should be retrieve-able
57a07b965623ed07ff09dcb1;For anyone who loves a challenge : ) I've been playing this game for a long time, and I've constantly kept it on my devices. Incredibly difficult game, but honestly once you beat your previous record the satisfaction is much greater. I look forward to future updates! : ) I recommend this to anyone who loves a challenge.
57a07b965623ed07ff09dcb2;Great game controls Tap where to move, tap where to attack. It works really well. The content is awesome. Its open source and ads free. Amazing
57a07b965623ed07ff09dcb3;It is amazing overall This is an awesome game they made it pretty good
57a07b995623ed07ff09dcb4;Super addicting Simple game yet i find myself trying 'just one more time' and I still haven't made it past the fourth floor. Because you don't spend any time on character creation, or even much time on character development, besides your inventory, the constant death isn't really annoying.
57a07b995623ed07ff09dcb5;Endless Fun ! This is my favorite game ! Get this and hopefully like me you love it! 3 thumbs up haha
57a07b995623ed07ff09dcb6;Meh I don't quite like the fact that there are ghosts because I don't know how to kill them.
57a07b995623ed07ff09dcb7;Play it at night I found it easier at night. More monsters, more gear and more food.
57a07b9c5623ed07ff09dcb8;Was Excellent now okay EDIT: I have been playing the game for a few years now and have beaten it on one occasion. However, it seems to me that the game is getting harder as time goes by. I agree with others that the item degradation may not have been well thought out as well as the fact that keys must some times be randomly generated in the room they are supposed to unlock which is frustrating. This is making the game lose its FUN status that it used to have.
57a07b9f5623ed07ff09dcb9;Too hard.
57a07b9f5623ed07ff09dcba;seeds dont work as meant when you throw the seed in the enemy... the effect of seed wont work as meant to be... the mobs need to step on it(or you) to trigger... better fix this
57a07b9f5623ed07ff09dcbb;Donate as many times as you can! Wonderful gameplay, sound, and mechanics. Despite what others say, keep the permadeath! It forces you to learn to be a better player! Keep up the great work!
57a07b9f5623ed07ff09dcbc;Amazing. My favorite game. I have spent so many hours in this game. It is random and fun and you'll never uninstall it.
57a07ba65623ed07ff09dcbd;Addictive but hard. Excellent game, no ads. Very difficult but that only increases the replay value. Thanks!
57a07ba65623ed07ff09dcbe;Lots of potential could use a little bit more Could use a more clear way of getting through to the player feels like there is somthing missing
57a07ba65623ed07ff09dcbf;Awesome game ! This is by far one of the best dungeon rpg, i ever play on this market. IT'S FREE, and don't have any pay to win sistem. I highly recommended this game to anyone that like a old style rpg like game, but there's some stuff that i hope the developer tweak tho. For example why not made it that when you level up, your hp and other negative buff is healed completely, and make the coin actually useful on low level dungeon, and add a skill tree so that we can notice more that the characters have grow stronger, etc
57a07ba85623ed07ff09dcc0;I install it again aftwr my phone got fixed. Now its lag. Please fix ! Thanks
57a07ba85623ed07ff09dcc1;Very addicting and fun It is extremely fun, it took me over 300 tries to win, and they were all fun playthroughs
57a07ba85623ed07ff09dcc2;Dark Souls: Prepare to Mobile The game is great and challenging. Danger in every corner ;_;
57a07baa5623ed07ff09dcc3;Needs better difficulty balancing This could potentially be a great game, maybe even worth 5 stars. However, what's currently keeping it away from that is the fact that the difficulty of this game isn't greatly ballanced at all. I know this is supposed to be a difficult game but it's still ridiculous how steep the difficulty curve is. This often causes deaths that I don't even feel are my fault which is not a good sign. However, as mentioned, if this curve would be improved I'd be very happy with this game.
57a07baa5623ed07ff09dcc4;Awesome New maps every time! And only takes up 4mb. How do you do this?
57a07baa5623ed07ff09dcc5;i need to retry why theres nothing "Retry" button please reply or a respawn button please üò≠
57a07bae5623ed07ff09dcc6;Best game ever Pretty hard though
57a07bae5623ed07ff09dcc7;Please toggle item degradation Please make item degradation be a difficulty toggle. I've beat this game over 100 times but this just sucks the fun out of it. All the other pixel Dungeon apps are trash and make the game too easy. This was perfect before that.
57a07bae5623ed07ff09dcc8;8 bit Rogue like but not Rogue Fun but has many detractors IMHO. Wait is on lvl 1(Can not be killed), Food is scarce(Death by starvation), If you make it past the ooze of dodging and find the shop on lvl 6. The prices are unaffordable. Was fun, but during on lvl 1 gets boring.
57a07bb15623ed07ff09dcc9;I used an ankh, but it said an error occurred... WHAT GIVES!!! IT TOO ME FOREVER TO GET WHERE I WAS!
57a07bb15623ed07ff09dcca;Amazing RPG for mobile, beat expectations. I love this game, there is serious difficulty but it's a very fun experience. The only mobile game I'll choose to play over games on my PC.
57a07bb15623ed07ff09dccb;Love it
57a07bb15623ed07ff09dccc;Cool game My title
57a07bb15623ed07ff09dccd;I have spent many hours playing this fabulous game and it still entertains me.
57a07bb85623ed07ff09dcce;The game is excellent but I play it on my tablet all the time but on smaller devices it's hard to hit enemies and just turn around it and most of the rooms in the game have nothing in it and die because the mobs are over powered and I don't have strong weapons to find it.
57a07bb85623ed07ff09dccf;Really hard time killer
57a07bb85623ed07ff09dcd0;Fun game Challenging yet simple to understand. I like it.
57a07bb85623ed07ff09dcd1;Very Good...better than the rest A good, interesting and hard game
57a07bbc5623ed07ff09dcd2;Amazing and addicting I love it. I just have one problem... I wake up early in the morning (say 5:00 - 6:00) and "Be cautious because Pixel Dungeon is more dangerous at night!" It's just so annoying. I forgot about that and lost a really good run to it! This would have no problems if you removed that.
57a07bbc5623ed07ff09dcd3;Great game but... The difficulty in this game is insane. The overall game is great but certain things make it nearly unplayable to me such as difficulty, perma-death, and totally random hit chances. After a bit of polishing this game will be a must have.
57a07bbc5623ed07ff09dcd4;Good concept bad game play Like the concept but theres not enough direction with items. You get armour you put it on and then find out its cursed and cant take it off. Basicly you might as well start over. Game gets very annoying like that.
57a07bbe5623ed07ff09dcd5;Best Ever
57a07bbe5623ed07ff09dcd6;Its Awesome! No problems for me! :D
57a07bbe5623ed07ff09dcd7;Hard as balls. But so fun...
57a07bbe5623ed07ff09dcd8;Super hard Super fun
57a07bbe5623ed07ff09dcd9;Hard but fun It is really fun
57a07bc05623ed07ff09dcda;so hard Am I the only one that finds this game infuriatingly hard. I made it to the first boss twice and i have been playing fpr like 3 days. love this game though. very addictive.
57a07bc05623ed07ff09dcdb;Awesome Awesome game, lol. Found a way to take all items from shop: 1. Get one of those killing scrolls from the sacrifical chamber 2. Stand outside the shop 3. Read the scroll. You have to be standing outside the shop for this to work... If ur inside he teleports away like normal.
57a07bc05623ed07ff09dcdc;Lol
57a07bc45623ed07ff09dcdd;best mobile RPG this game is really really hard, but fun too. There is a Steam version for $5 which is a very basic PC port. I bought that version too as a way of donating to the developers and I highly recommend you download this game.
57a07bc45623ed07ff09dcde;For a few years I've been occasionally playing this game and now it has become a lot more interesting :) not simplier but funnier I guess, well done!
57a07bc45623ed07ff09dcdf;Difficult in a petty way. I like the game for the most part, but the degradation mechanic is bullshit. I played this game in my off time for a solid week, so couldn't beat it. All my good items keep breaking.
57a07bca5623ed07ff09dce0;8-b8t I always been addicted to pixel games! It makes me feel like a chef ready to fight fishes and play ... i dont even know. Happy birthday???
57a07bd05623ed07ff09dce1;Amazing Game!
57a07bd05623ed07ff09dce2;Completely free, completely awesome. No ads, continually updated,great fun. A perfect roguelike for your Android device. Really do consider donating to this Dev,the game is worth a few quid at least and he gives it away 100% free with no ads or microtransactions at all.make sure to get this version, and not a copy trying to make money off this devs hard work.
57a07bd05623ed07ff09dce3;Amazing It's a dungeon crawler to the bone. You spawn in a random dungeon, armed only with your knowledge from past runs and hope. Expect many hours of play from this game!
57a07bd35623ed07ff09dce4;One of the best games on the play store Pixel dungeon is a magnificent roguelike. It and it's many fan-made versions have exactly what I was looking for.
57a07bd35623ed07ff09dce5;Amazing It looks like a simple game but it isn't, you start playing and it's addictive, has hard bosses and it's different each time. And there's so many items you can get that help in some way.
57a07bd35623ed07ff09dce6;Amazing! It is challenging , fun , many cool new stuff! Love your game!!!‚ô•‚ô°
57a07bd35623ed07ff09dce7;Played this for hourz Loooove it neverending boredom
57a07be15623ed07ff09dce8;Funny but hard. It is so funny but when you die on the 5th floor with the best stuff you can get because bamn rat kills you... It is not just funny at all!
57a07be15623ed07ff09dce9;Awesome but challenging I love this game that's why I give this game a 5 star rating
57a07be15623ed07ff09dcea;BADASS Finally, a challenge. Gives me flashbacks of the original Zelda games and Hexen, no objectives and constant danger. When not dodging roaming creatures with a sliver of health, you'll find fear in choosing what potions and scrolls you use, as some can be your demise. Overall, a badass randomized dungeon crawler \m/
57a07be15623ed07ff09dceb;So great!! In love with the game
57a07bf05623ed07ff09dcec;Great game but you should try to improve the combat interface cuz when i tap on the enemies the guy just walks behind and i find the attack button too uncomfortable
57a07bf05623ed07ff09dced;Best game ever Thanks
57a07bf05623ed07ff09dcee;Addicting yes but So hard
57a07bf05623ed07ff09dcef;Wonderful game
57a07bf05623ed07ff09dcf0;Suggestions I love the game but I think there is a lot missing to like I think there should be a shop in the menu and micro purchases and add a different currency but not that hard to get
57a07bfc5623ed07ff09dcf1;Amazing Just the best mobile game i have ever played AND ! The only good game that isnt a money grab. Also very challenging.
57a07bfc5623ed07ff09dcf2;Coming from an rpg lover... Get this app, guys. If you loved any old, turn-based rpg you played on the old Gameboy, you'll love this. There's a perfect blend of fun, logic and a little bit of a challenge all mixed together to make this roguelike phenomenon. It's not the best game I've ever played, but it would definitely be on my top ten list. Now, if there was only an ability to craft your own weapons... you already got partially there with the option brewing. Really fun, 9.5/10.
57a07bfc5623ed07ff09dcf3;Awesome Addictive, amazing, retro, AND it doesn't take up much space! Thank you for making an awesome game!!
57a07c085623ed07ff09dcf4;Super Intrigante
57a07c085623ed07ff09dcf5;Great game but I have all the times you die!
57a07c085623ed07ff09dcf6;Took me ages to beat
57a07c085623ed07ff09dcf7;Aasssoommme &lt;3
57a07c085623ed07ff09dcf8;Really fun But, is there more classes to be if you donate
57a07c185623ed07ff09dcf9;I love this game, I can play it for a few minutes on break at work, standing in line or i can play it for hours while i try to fall asleep or i'm waiting for my cue to pop. I have yet to beat the lvl 15 boss... but i've made it there with a warrior and mage... still having trouble with that little rouge... I cant seem to beat lvl 10 with him... but i will... one day, i want to see his mastery! I would say get this game if your easily enteratined, the map, pots and scrolls change every time you start over. Warriors will always know a pot of strength, mages a scroll of identifay, and rouges seem to like maps. There is some other cool little perks about the classes, but its better to figure out as you play. I'm giving it 5 stars... cant wait to see what lvl 16 looks like, or the huntress for that matter.
57a07c185623ed07ff09dcfa;Insane game I like it a lot
57a07c185623ed07ff09dcfb;5/5 Pretty fun, quite difficult in the later levels.
57a07c225623ed07ff09dcfc;Good for pooping This game rly fun and engaging but not so much that u will get lost in it while on the can and forget to get back to work
57a07c225623ed07ff09dcfd;Best game Best game for mobile devices. I like how it requires no permissions unlike other games and works flawlessly despite being free and open source.
57a07c225623ed07ff09dcfe;Great game I Donated 5$. Please do so if you realize that you play this game often without seeing ads or having to pay for ad ons
57a07c225623ed07ff09dcff;The best Rouge like for android to date Simple, in depth, but also surprisingly difficult. Lots of content and even more secrets and surprises. Would recommend to anyone who's into hardcore rogue-like games
57a07c265623ed07ff09dd00;The once great has been surpassed. Given me hours of fun, but I can't bring myself to play the with degradation. Still have to give credit, especially since the game is released open source and the branches still give me plenty of good times.
57a07c265623ed07ff09dd01;Love it Brilliant... need I say more?
57a07c265623ed07ff09dd02;Awsome I like how you could explore
57a07c265623ed07ff09dd03;Meh It's ok
57a07c265623ed07ff09dd04;Used to be an awesome roguelike I used to love this, but ever since degradation was added this game has gone downhill.
57a07c335623ed07ff09dd05;Really fun game Really fun game. Every time you start a new game you get a different experience that makes you want to stay and play. The only thing that I didn't like was the lack of difference between the characters; they don't feel very different to me.
57a07c335623ed07ff09dd06;Help me... ;_; have only gotten as far as the 5th floor...
57a07c335623ed07ff09dd07;Good I can't Last 3 minutes in the game, but still good
57a07c335623ed07ff09dd08;AMAZING
57a07c375623ed07ff09dd09;Loved it really fun
57a07c375623ed07ff09dd0a;GREAT GAME Please add a multiplayer if possible
57a07c375623ed07ff09dd0b;Love it It's so funn and addiction
57a07c375623ed07ff09dd0c;This is the best thing since sliced bread Bread
57a07c375623ed07ff09dd0d;How To Win Save upgrades for when armor/weapons are T4/5 and are about to break. Farm healing potions from flies on lvl 6 with weapon unequipped so you get a lot of them, and from bats on lvl 11. It's the key to beating the demon levels (and the game).
57a07c3a5623ed07ff09dd0e;Good game But it is a complete rip off of legend of yore but with better graphics
57a07c3a5623ed07ff09dd0f;Too hard. I think it's too hard, you have to be really lucky to get enough food or weapons.
57a07c3a5623ed07ff09dd10;OK good BUT OK: 1-it is so annoying when you get so far into the game then you die and have to restart. 2-just think what it should be like if there was a multiplayer mode
57a07c3a5623ed07ff09dd11;I love Rogue. Nice port! Keep up the good work. : )
57a07c3d5623ed07ff09dd12;Runbish Can never get past the first level always die no matter what can't get chance to level up your strength to use other items
57a07c3d5623ed07ff09dd13;This is good Although is it possible to even save your game? Or am I not familiar with the play style?
57a07c3d5623ed07ff09dd14;10/10, definitely. Addicting fun, absolutely no ads, auto save... Couldn't get any better. :)
57a07c3d5623ed07ff09dd15;A hard rouge light with what seems to be no microtransactions. But does have a donate button so thumbs up developers.
57a07c4a5623ed07ff09dd16;Needs improvement There is absolutely no purpose to finding gold and getting achievements in this game, it's a waste of time and I can't see why any time was spent in development on either of these things. Do something with it or get rid of it. Add a shop, make it so getting achievements provides boosts for fresh games. Plenty can be done, but nothing was, and it's disappointing.
57a07c4a5623ed07ff09dd17;10/10 IGN AWESOME GAME
57a07c575623ed07ff09dd18;A hidden gem, a game true to itself and what it wants to be played as. It's loads of fun! The game at first was extremely difficult. It had me dying at floor 3 every time. Although I died a lot I was determined to reach at least the first boss...eventually I did, but I was completely destroyed in the first few moves. I realized something after a few more tries, that I had learned new skills I could use in each new playthrough, I saw that I was progressing as a player, not my character. this is genius, the player is the one gaining experience, becoming a better dungeon crawler by mind, not XP.
57a07c575623ed07ff09dd19;Great game Very inspiring! Thank you!
57a07c575623ed07ff09dd1a;Fun challenging time killer Very nice simple, love it. Great time killer
57a07c6b5623ed07ff09dd1b;Great roguelike That's one of the best rpg in the playstore
57a07c6b5623ed07ff09dd1c;Pretty cool I like this game because it reminds me of my young childhood life of video games
57a07c6b5623ed07ff09dd1d;I have a suggestion!!! 1 complaint: starving too fast u gotta do somthing. Now to the suggestions... #1 add 1 more classes to each char pls like warrior:brawler(attacks effectively barehanded or with a knuckleduster) & rogue:thief (which can steal stuff from enemies randomly) mage:summoner(summons some sort of creature at the expense of hunger) huntress:amazon (can use spears as throwing weapon) well hope u read mu suggeation I still have more if you want
57a07c6f5623ed07ff09dd1e;Okey game Meh. If you die then you die, no extra lives, start all over.
57a07c6f5623ed07ff09dd1f;Unfairly challenging This game is wash compared to the reviews ive seen due to its unfair RNG and annoying hunger stat. you cant take your time and enjoy yourself.
57a07c6f5623ed07ff09dd20;Way too hard Awesome game but way too hard. Should start out easy and gradually get harder.
57a07c6f5623ed07ff09dd21;Should be.. You should be able to save your progress..
57a07c725623ed07ff09dd22;Great pick up and play Whenever I get bored I can just turn on my phone and start playing. Pretty challenging too, and I like that.
57a07c725623ed07ff09dd23;Simply wonderful I love everything about this game. First off, it's truly free with no ads. Second and more importantly, it's fun and addictive. I have spent a lot of time playing it and it never gets old. I'm as cheap as they come and even I donated to this game. That's how much I love it.
57a07c725623ed07ff09dd24;Horrible No coming back to life
57a07c7e5623ed07ff09dd25;Not for noobs Bug: the imp collects only one token after he gives you the ring. Difficult but great game, based on luck and skill. People complaining about food and degradation don't know how to play properly. people that complain that potions and scrolls change don't understand the meaning of rogue-like.
57a07c7e5623ed07ff09dd26;Really good It SHOULD be hard
57a07c7e5623ed07ff09dd27;Please add controller support and TV support For nvidia shield tablet portable and TV need controller support
57a07c7e5623ed07ff09dd28;A lot of fun! I'll donate as soon as possible
57a07c8a5623ed07ff09dd29;Simple but amazing One of the best mobile games I've ever played
57a07c8a5623ed07ff09dd2a;Great game Wish he would update more constantly. Its been far too long of a wait.
57a07c8a5623ed07ff09dd2b;I would have given this 5 stars had I reviewed it prior to item durability being introduced. This is a great example of an extremely gifted programmer who is an absolute moron when it comes to actual game mechanics. I had a +6 Ring of Evasion and a +7 Warhammer, and no way to repair either one, so I died. What a bunch of fun.
57a07c8a5623ed07ff09dd2c;Best game on Android In this game, I killed a dark god with a flaming knuckleduster.
57a07c9b5623ed07ff09dd2d;Difficult. This game does not bend the word "roguelike". Every life restarts the machine, but with a new experience awaiting even with random potions. I recommend this to gamers of any kind that like new experiences and risk.
57a07c9b5623ed07ff09dd2e;Multiplayer Could be possible a multiplayer mode?
57a07c9b5623ed07ff09dd2f;Bug: Free badge I got the "get through a level without killing anything" badge... and I'm not sure what caused it. Step 1: Kill nothing, jump down into a chasm. Step 2: Kill nothing, go up a floor to finish it up. Step 3: Kill stuff, go down again. Then, I got the badge... pretty odd but not game-breaking or anything.
57a07c9b5623ed07ff09dd30;Getting rekt and loving it
57a07ca05623ed07ff09dd31;So friging good Loved it its like zelda
57a07ca05623ed07ff09dd32;Get this Never ending different every time very hard but fun years of replay value, the dev is on tap and will talk to you this game is still supported and monitored this is the original platform that every one else has taken from.
57a07ca05623ed07ff09dd33;Nope Too much trial and error, random unwinnable encounters even on the first level... skip this frustrating mess.
57a07ca05623ed07ff09dd34;Your score has degraded. Bummer.
57a07ca05623ed07ff09dd35;Get it Addictive, well made, and hard as nails. The best roguelike I've ever played.
57a07cab5623ed07ff09dd36;Right now this game is Far to easy, item spawn rates are far to high. Also you should only be given 1 free food per five levels to make it more challenging. And item durability is terrible please remove it. BTW did you give up watabou? You haven't updated since December.
57a07cab5623ed07ff09dd37;Such a frustrating game that makes me rage so many times and is close to impossible to finish ... Love it!
57a07cab5623ed07ff09dd38;Addicted This game is so addictive.
57a07cab5623ed07ff09dd39;Boring game
57a07cb75623ed07ff09dd3a;Is it even legal for all the fake versions of this game to exist?
57a07cb75623ed07ff09dd3b;Fun, addicting, easy to use. This game is easy to pick up, handles extremely well for a mobile game, and offers a new experience with every game.
57a07cb75623ed07ff09dd3c;Love it mann... is there any game like this??
57a07cbd5623ed07ff09dd3d;Too difficult for my tastes. I'm an avid gamer who likes a challenge now and again, but this game is challenging on an aggravating level. Health loss is common and unavoidable, scarce healing resources, hunger/ starvation comes on too quickly, scarce food resources, potions and scrolls are a crap-shoot so there is no way to strategize their use, and also permadeath. This game is kind of set up for you to lose. I enjoyed the other aspects though.
57a07cbd5623ed07ff09dd3e;ADD MORE I think this game should add more like more classes or maybe multiplayer lel but please just add more fun it will be interesting if there are more classes :)
57a07cbd5623ed07ff09dd3f;Fun Super
57a07cc85623ed07ff09dd40;Great game but way too much luck-based as the description states. Though I have an idea - co-op multiplayer or possibility to lead a 2-character party would be awesome.
57a07cc85623ed07ff09dd41;Awesome! Fun & addictive. Never the same game twice!
57a07cc85623ed07ff09dd42;Not obvious how to progress I understand that I'm going to die at first, but I can't really find a way to progress in this game, and that's frustrating, rather than fun, to me. Your mileage may vary.
57a07cc85623ed07ff09dd43;Best Android game This is one of the best game and time killer on Android. I've had this on my phone for a while to play whenever I'm bored. It's like a big small game to enjoy
57a07cd25623ed07ff09dd44;so fun!!
57a07cd25623ed07ff09dd45;Difficult but fun I can never get past the first few levels, but it's good fun anyway.
57a07cd25623ed07ff09dd46;Good
57a07cd25623ed07ff09dd47;Difficult enough to be interesting. Easy enough to be fun.
57a07cd25623ed07ff09dd48;Why are there so many copys? This game is too great to be stolen
57a07cd65623ed07ff09dd49;warning. gateway drug. i used to play Rogue on an Amstrad PC 1512, some time around the mid-1980's, when i was 6. but it was impossible. i'd never even heard of rogue-like's until now, and i thought that finally holding aloft the amulet of yendor would be a valuable opportunity to finally heal old wounds left in my infantile psyche.... how could i have been so very wrong ...? please, help me. help.
57a07cd65623ed07ff09dd4a;Hella fun. Hella hard I've been playing this game for Lord knows how long and I still can't beat it. I get father and father but still. Great challenge!
57a07ce25623ed07ff09dd4b;Cool, but... Quick question: Are all of the scrolls SUPPOSED to be randomized? It makes writing them down trying to know which one does what very frustrating. Especially if you're going to give each one their own names and glyphs. I'd like to eventually be like "Oh, cool, 'MANNAZ', I needed to enchant this scale armor..." BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS DIFFERENT unless I'm just not that observant...though my list has a bunch of erase marks on it...
57a07ce25623ed07ff09dd4c;All time fave Pixel Dungeon, prior to moving to open source, is the game I've played most on my phone. It's gotten better and better over the years. This is a perfect casual roguelike.
57a07cef5623ed07ff09dd4d;Perfect Description It's a representation of an old Rpg game it an video game app better than all others I found easy to move and play but not an easy game it's self I enjoy this game on a normal basis I hope and promise you can to.
57a07cef5623ed07ff09dd4e;Awesome Amazing game + no ads = 5‚òÜ ( I finished the game btw ). Donating as soon as possible.
57a07cef5623ed07ff09dd4f;Nice game! Thanks developers and testing team!
57a07cef5623ed07ff09dd50;Too hard
57a07cfc5623ed07ff09dd51;So good!! Very refreshing mobile game, with items and weapons with unknown stats being my most favourite mechanic. Having it open sourced makes it DESERVE 5 stars!! Live long!
57a07cfc5623ed07ff09dd52;S'ok But seriously, can anyone get anywhere in this game? Be prepared to die several hundred times before you install
57a07cfc5623ed07ff09dd53;Nice, but unfair This game has potential. It is an exciting game. However, I do not think it's fair that the only girl in the whole game is the huntress - bit yet, I wonder why - she's locked. I mean, give us girls a break! I have tried time and time again to kill the 3rd boss to unlock her, to my failure for the 1,000 time (or something like that). This is my final cry of help; with this fixed, it might improve the game a lot.
57a07cfe5623ed07ff09dd54;Muhte≈üem bir oyun Warrior la 22. Kata indim orda g√∂z gibi bir ≈üey var acƒ±mƒ±yor adama :)
57a07cfe5623ed07ff09dd55;Challenging It's fun, hard and doesn't have ads or take up alot of data.
57a07cfe5623ed07ff09dd56;Amazing Best game I have ever played and very challenging
57a07cfe5623ed07ff09dd57;Favorite phone game It's the only game I've kept on my phone for 3 years straight- never gets old
57a07d0b5623ed07ff09dd58;Amazing is an understatement I got my phone in 2012 and downloaded this game, to this day I still play, very much worth the download
57a07d0e5623ed07ff09dd59;Terrific Game Terrific game with great depth, and amazing complexity and flexibility. Love it!
57a07d0e5623ed07ff09dd5a;Omg This game is better than cod black ops 3
57a07d0e5623ed07ff09dd5b;So simple, alot of skill I love this game it actually requires you think. At first the permanent death ticked me off but you always can get more gear.
57a07d0e5623ed07ff09dd5c;I HATE IT SO MUCH BUT I CAN'T STAP PLAYING IT!!
57a07d125623ed07ff09dd5d;Great game that doesn't need internet It's fun and exciting because each play through is very different from the last. No Internet is a great plus. No ads. Concept is simple, the challenge is hard but feels good
57a07d125623ed07ff09dd5e;The original and best
57a07d125623ed07ff09dd5f;Minor flaws, otherwise phenomenal I can't put this game down. I keep dying over and over but it keeps drawing me in. Sometimes luck is in my favor and other times not so much. Knowing how much HP I have would be helpful if it could be listed in the bar instead of just a graphical representation. Also if the option to have a second quickslot could be permanently changed when I select it that would be great. Gets a little tiresome having to reselect it every new game.
57a07d1f5623ed07ff09dd60;Just what I needed Something easy to pick up but challenging to master. Loads of fun!
57a07d1f5623ed07ff09dd61;Good but hard A proper game for once! Fun, and no microtransactions (unless you count donations). Definitely worth downloading if you like a challenge.
57a07d1f5623ed07ff09dd62;Item degradation isn't too bad... To fix the problem of using all upgrade scrolls on one item, just to repair it, an idea could be to add random drops used to repair items, and make them a drop from common enemies. Please consider this, because there's nothing I hate more than not being able to upgrade my armour, all because of my +6 warhammer is broken. Aside from the this the game is very simplistic and easy to play, unlike other Android/IOS games. Keep up the good work Watabou and team
57a07d2a5623ed07ff09dd63;Sooo fun! Its addicting at first, but boring after some time. Please add more health, strenghth, characters, or checkpoints or something. Can use some developement.
57a07d2a5623ed07ff09dd64;There is 1 thing that is bad not about the game or anything it is better than Minecraft!!!! There is 2 much ripoffs!
57a07d2a5623ed07ff09dd65;Pretty Cool RPG Description by the Dev says all, simple but fun Roguelike with an easy interface and enough depth to keep you coming back for more every run. Good stuff
57a07d2e5623ed07ff09dd66;What?! You cant save, it always asks you for something you dont have(food, health, weapons, etc.), it throws too many enemies at you at once. Cant play more than 15 minutes till death! Add the save mechanic for christ sake!
57a07d2e5623ed07ff09dd67;One of the best It's a quality game and definitely challenging!
57a07d2e5623ed07ff09dd68;GIVE ME MOAR!! This game is awesome for hours of frustration and days of planning before your next move, love it! But now that I have the amulet of yendor on all classes I'm hungry for more content &gt;.&lt; keep up the good work!
57a07d3a5623ed07ff09dd69;The best around Free, exciting and challenging gameplay, no adds or privacy invading permissions. What more could you ask for? Absolutely knocked it out of the ballpark!
57a07d3a5623ed07ff09dd6a;Good idea But there should be a difficulty option for people who can't make it past level 4. xD
57a07d3a5623ed07ff09dd6b;Fun but hard Sometimes it feels like the game decides if it wants you to do well or not. One time I killed the first three bosses. Now I'm struggling to get past the first one. It's a little ridiculous how helpless you are sometimes. It's worth playing though
57a07d475623ed07ff09dd6c;Great game but... Would like to see an update to keep up with it's competition. It could even be bug fixes but, to look and see that it hasn't been touched since December and the others February; you begin to question is it still in development. A nice feature to add would be a trinket slot and have like 20 different trinkets that we could use. Many people liked TBOIs different gameplay scheme and that would be nice here as well
57a07d475623ed07ff09dd6d;This is awesome. Simple, fun, replayable.
57a07d475623ed07ff09dd6e;Lol, good game but please Nerf wraiths holy sh*t
57a07d5e5623ed07ff09dd6f;Great game I am addicted to this game however can you please make it so that you can buy the huntress. I have dyslexia so I do struggle a little with the game and would love the huntress. Thanks
57a07d5e5623ed07ff09dd70;best app evah ive been playing this for a week now and the lowest i gould get is lvl 13!!! thia game is so difficult but its still fun to play because u learn something new every time u play. its very entertaining and frustrating at the same time haha
57a07d5e5623ed07ff09dd71;Pixel dungeon Rpg great little game reminds me of my youth disappointed no saves but cant stop play
57a07d6b5623ed07ff09dd72;This is legit addicting Hello, I usually don't review stuff but this game man, this game is pretty awesome, the right level of difficulty, its random generated maps per say, upgradable stuff and lots to explore thus far 10/10. Either casual or hardcore keeps your entertained, I play it a lot now
57a07d6b5623ed07ff09dd73;Amazing This game is amazing
57a07d705623ed07ff09dd74;A challenging, pixelated master piece. I have always been a fan of pixelated style games, and more so for dungeon RPG exploration type ones. Pixel Dungeon blends all my favorite flavors together quite perfectly to create a simple yet challenging, risk-taking, and loot finding game, that has striped me countless hours, and turned it into rage hard fun. This is one of the best yet simple games I've played so far. Much love for this game and it's awesome developers, hope to see more updates with tons of new stuff if possible. üòä p.s. it's on PC too
57a07d705623ed07ff09dd75;Well, it's ok, but... I wish there's a "continue or save button".
57a07d705623ed07ff09dd76;Awesome game
57a07d7a5623ed07ff09dd77;Can you add multiplayer plz
57a07d7a5623ed07ff09dd78;So much fun!! Love this game. Interesting and challenging with the right elements if gameplay, skill and chance. Thoroughly addicted. Much play time!!
57a07d7a5623ed07ff09dd79;Awesome game Everything about pixel dungeon is so awesome. It's deadly punishing, but it makes it that much more rewarding to beat the game. You have to be really careful with what you're given - every item down to the last dewdrop counts! - and in the deeper you go the more strategic you have to be. Thanks for making such an amazing experience, and happy dungeon crawling!
57a07d865623ed07ff09dd7a;Enjoyable and challanging Well i still try to win it so thanks for the game it made me remember old dungeon which full of challenge
57a07d865623ed07ff09dd7b;GNU GPL v3.0? You know I could just call this Pixel Dungeons and charge $5 for it, right? Or just change your donation info to be attached to my bank account? Wait, someone did that....REMIX Pixel Dungeon!
57a07d865623ed07ff09dd7c;perfect this game is perfection. simple enough to keep playing, challenging enough to keep trying
57a07d865623ed07ff09dd7d;Amazing rouge rpg! I have always wanted to play a rouge rpg but I never got around to looking for one. This game is amazing in how it has sooo much replay ability!
57a07d9b5623ed07ff09dd7e;Impressive Cool games, it bring me back to my 90s.
57a07d9b5623ed07ff09dd7f;My favorite roguelike game This game has an incredible amount of complexity and replayability. I played about 200 games before I figured most of it out. After 550 games I have finally beat the game with all 4 classes and made it back out to the top with the warrior. Great sound effects and music. A typical game can last you anywhere from 1 minute to an hour. A great quick diversion that can hold your attention for a long time. I only have 4 more badges to get! You won't regret getting this game. The best part? NO ADS!
57a07d9b5623ed07ff09dd80;Dungeon roll king Love it.
57a07da85623ed07ff09dd81;Win Love this game
57a07da85623ed07ff09dd82;Terrible game Can't get past the 3rd level. Everything kills you.
57a07da85623ed07ff09dd83;A lot of fun!! For such a small game (especially on a phone where I don't expect actual fun most of the time), I find myself playing a lot of this. -The only problem I have found so far is the food mechanic. It seems arbitrary as to how much it fills you up, but it never lasts very long. I always seem to be starving by mid level 2-3 of each run.
57a07da85623ed07ff09dd84;What's the point in this game if there is no end to it.
57a07dac5623ed07ff09dd85;CONFIRM a Add some weapons and armor for best gameplay
57a07dac5623ed07ff09dd86;Awesome game!! No In-App purchases or advertisements. It's a really fun game.
57a07dac5623ed07ff09dd87;Super This game is so am@zing
57a07dac5623ed07ff09dd88;Pls add save So I dont lose EVERYTHING when I die, mostly because I wanna get cool items and actually see the ending
57a07dac5623ed07ff09dd89;Epic! I have a suggestion though, please add a beast tamer class that can summon creatures to help you fight!
57a07dba5623ed07ff09dd8a;Finally a legit game Finally i found a legit game,no adds,no in appa purchages, plus its an awesome rpg,simple,pick up and play,addictive,challenging.What else can you say.Defenatly gove it a shot
57a07dba5623ed07ff09dd8b;Frustration dungeon is more like it. My favorite mobile game but my god it needs some fixing!
57a07dba5623ed07ff09dd8c;CAN'T PUT DOWN! I keep dying but can't stop playing.
57a07dba5623ed07ff09dd8d;Highly addictive Fun to play and don't cost much space
57a07dc45623ed07ff09dd8e;Awesome People who dont understand the potions: they are DELIBERATLY switched each game. And most of the mechanics people complain about are done on purpose.
57a07dc45623ed07ff09dd8f;!GREAT! ....GREAT IDEAS IN THIS VIDEO GAME AND GREAT POTENTIAL....
57a07dc45623ed07ff09dd90;Best game ever This has been my favorite game I've played on a portable device. It is well thought out and very addictive.
57a07dc85623ed07ff09dd91;Awesome Super fun game, it's a great time waster for when I'm waiting for an appointment or some other event. Biggest problem is the durability on weapons and armor. The game is so much harder now that you can't just rely on a good sword or hammer all the time. Battle mage isn't as good either. I don't hate the idea but I think it should at least be an option to the player if they want to play with it as a factor ot not. Besides that great game.
57a07dc85623ed07ff09dd92;Love the game Love this game, but really need a code for food. It always gets me. Can't get past lvl 8-9 without starving. Rushing to find food. But great game...!!!
57a07dc85623ed07ff09dd93;Very good game! Extremely addictive!!! Why not add different difficulty modes and you first start on easy and then work your way up?
57a07dd45623ed07ff09dd94;Loved it Ive always liked games like this
57a07dd45623ed07ff09dd95;Really fun, small rpg. Cool game but frustratingly difficult. Not a long term rpg, only meant to kill small chunks of time. As long as you go in realizing that it's fun.
57a07dd45623ed07ff09dd96;Very good! Its only 5mb on dl and it doesnt eat up too much ram or battery
57a07dd45623ed07ff09dd97;I play this whenever I run out of Internet on my phone, really fun and addictive game
57a07dd45623ed07ff09dd98;Challenging and fun While luck is a factor when it comes to success in this game, it's still rewarding to progress
57a07dd85623ed07ff09dd99;Amazing and addicting! I love the game despite my lack of experience with roguelikes. Still haven't beaten it yet but I play it constantly. One thing I might recommend though is rebalancing he hunger and food, either make satiety points decrease slower, increase the potency of food and the satiety point cap, or increase the frequency of food drops. Starvation has been the thing that killed me the most, and I'm very sparing with any food I get only eating when starving. Would be 5 stars if not for the hunger!
57a07dd85623ed07ff09dd9a;The best game on the app store Somebody actually put effort into a free game with no in-app purchases. Kudos, devs. Your the best.
57a07de35623ed07ff09dd9b;Good roguelike The game is tightly controlled, easy to understand, and overall a good rendition of the Roguelike genre. It's pretty standard though, and doesn't do anything too out of the ordinary. Great app!
57a07de35623ed07ff09dd9c;What phenomenal depth!!!!! I can't say how much I love this game. There is sooo many things that you can do. Tantalizingly Challenging!
57a07df15623ed07ff09dd9d;Amazing I feel the best part about this game was that it is not addicting. It's fun. The two words have a difference. I actively want to play pixel dungeon. Yet games like coc basically force you to come back, and then leave right away. My only complaint is of how it isn't super balanced, where most playthroughs you have no chance, and some you get a lightning wand in the first room you find. Other than that, pixel dungeon is a fun game definitely worth trying out.
57a07df15623ed07ff09dd9e;Overall addictive First things first: if you find a way to conserve food, take it. Sometimes you will be spending a long time on a floor and starving is a common death. (Also, go to settings and activate second quickslot) This game is very fun, being able to drag you in for a hour at a time. But, thanks to it saving every move you make, you can stop at any time. There's a massive level of customization in playstyle.
57a07dfc5623ed07ff09dd9f;Not my kind of game anymore Don't care for degradation, but other then that, it be a fun little time killer game
57a07dfc5623ed07ff09dda0;Love it
57a07dfc5623ed07ff09dda1;Awesome
57a07dfc5623ed07ff09dda2;Original The game is simple but quite challenging upon playing the first 5 floors, this game is the best.
57a07dfc5623ed07ff09dda3;This game is for stupids
57a07e135623ed07ff09dda4;Damn good! It speaks for itself.
57a07e135623ed07ff09dda5;Super hard and the sounds creep me out when your character dies.
57a07e135623ed07ff09dda6;Unforgiving roguelike. Great timeframe and interface for mobile. High replayability.
57a07e135623ed07ff09dda7;Really fun but Its just sao hard
57a07e135623ed07ff09dda8;Vavorite Game XD I love it so much dammit ...... I have a few thing that may make the game better first please add joystick like you can change beetween joystick and click to move second pls pls pls add multiplayer i want to play with my friend thanks
57a07e225623ed07ff09dda9;You should add more main classes but otherwise amazing game
57a07e225623ed07ff09ddaa;NEW BEST PUZZLE GAME Wow Very impressive... I love it it's so challenging and addictive
57a07e225623ed07ff09ddab;Great game, and completely free This game is lots of fun, and it's completely free, no in app purchases (I know, it's in the app permissions, but that's just to donate to the developers) if you're thinking of getting it, you definitely should at least try it!
57a07e225623ed07ff09ddac;Still has rooms without keys and degrade Used a map layout and yup no key...
57a07e2b5623ed07ff09ddad;Literal roguelike It's literally like rogue. It's rogue with graphics and touch controls.
57a07e2b5623ed07ff09ddae;Best Rouge experience This is the second best rougelike game of all time, first being Rouge Legacy, but that's not on android, so this is number one on google play, gets updated often, and extremely simple yet definitely difficult, only improvement I would wish for is more classes and/or speci class skills such as a battlecry buff for the warrior or such.
57a07e2b5623ed07ff09ddaf;Good game! I realy love this game! It is perfectly crafted and thought turku. And also challenging! Sometimes even too hard! (Thats what she said)
57a07e325623ed07ff09ddb0;Amazing If you like Castle of the Winds, you won't be disappointed. New experience every game and it's well-polished. Awesome game!
57a07e325623ed07ff09ddb1;Dark souls on Android! Very addictive, combine with a spooky asmosphere, it's a must-have for hardcore gamer :)
57a07e325623ed07ff09ddb2;Too hard This game would be so much better if they gave you instructions on how not to die within a few minutes or give you a save option. Still pretty fun though.
57a07e325623ed07ff09ddb3;Excellent game I would have gladly paid $10 for.
57a07e365623ed07ff09ddb4;Rpg game G8 game m80s.
57a07e365623ed07ff09ddb5;More characters Please others characters more. And support for more languages
57a07e365623ed07ff09ddb6;Starve too fast You starve waaaay too fast in this game sometimes having to use multiple rations in a single floor. You're also expected to memorize every single potion type as any recorded experiments don't carry over to the next toon. Too much trial and error that doesn't get rewarded on further play throughs, skip this game it is a waste of time
57a07e445623ed07ff09ddb7;Amazing game I have had this game on three different devices and played it for almost two years. I have beaten it with the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes, the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise. Stand in water while fighting to wash away his caustic ooze and use an earth root for added protection. Good luck!!
57a07e445623ed07ff09ddb8;Lovvveee it!! The fact that there is no death penalty (but needing to restart the level) there's no reason to get mad at the game. Plus the pixeled graphics makes this game the BEST!!!!!! 10/10 Awesome game.
57a07e505623ed07ff09ddb9;Its ok not my style ..i cant stand tap to move games i wish it had arrows so i could move freely but yea
57a07e505623ed07ff09ddba;My fav game Game is hard, but I love it everytime you play everything is different
57a07e505623ed07ff09ddbb;Awesome game, but a idea... Can you make a DLC or something for like, a new chapter for Pixel Dungeon? Would be appreciated if you did. Example: Dracula's Curse of Pixel Dungeon. Just a example, probably something better. Also, make it be like $0.99 for DLC, or at least $2.00? Plz make a new chapter or something cool to the strory!
57a07e505623ed07ff09ddbc;Omg bwst RPG for phone I Love THE Hardcore
57a07e5d5623ed07ff09ddbd;Wow
57a07e5d5623ed07ff09ddbe;It's fun
57a07e5d5623ed07ff09ddbf;You should be able to have your progress saved on other devices or atleast have your achaivements transfered so you can have the huntress unlocked on all hour devices
57a07e5d5623ed07ff09ddc0;Ranting 28 deaths, most at lvl 1 or 2, never made it past floor 3 due to rations never spawning and hunger killing me. Tbh hunger system ruins the game for me since infinite number of monsters spawn while rations are very limited. But that can just be RNGesus hating me.
57a07e635623ed07ff09ddc1;&lt;3
57a07e635623ed07ff09ddc2;Good Why can't I ever get past floor 2...
57a07e635623ed07ff09ddc3;So tough And yet addictively playable.
57a07e635623ed07ff09ddc4;best rogue-like around! this is an amazing game! it's free! they don't beat you over the head asking for a rating! IAP? nope! just a $5 donate button, which you will definitely want to hit after you see how awesome this game is!
57a07e635623ed07ff09ddc5;Good lightweight game
57a07e675623ed07ff09ddc6;Easily hooked üòÅ Cant a believe a simple game like dis can actually fill up d time i usually spent waiting for other stuffs üòÇ
57a07e675623ed07ff09ddc7;Fun Retro Dungeon Crawler A little difficult, but addictive when you're determine. Straight forward arcade game where you must survive to find the treasure deep underground. Best part, no hidden burdens like adware and nagware.
57a07e675623ed07ff09ddc8;The best around... Honestly, out of all the app games I've ever downloaded (over a 4 year span) this one holds and retains the highest pedistal. No ads, no weird interfaces. Just old school Rogue-like RPG awesomeness. It's quite a challenge though. Expect to fail and die and start over A LOT
57a07e735623ed07ff09ddc9;Please remove degration Scroll of upgrades are too scarce and both armor and weapons degrade scroll renewal ain't enough
57a07e735623ed07ff09ddca;You should add bows.
57a07e735623ed07ff09ddcb;Amazing! This game remembers me tibia... To describe in one word is EPIC
57a07e735623ed07ff09ddcc;Absolutely love this game! I have put countless of hours in this game! I absolutely love this game. The game is super simple and easy to pick up but very hard to master. I've played 100 games and still have yet to beat it. I recommend this game quite strongly.
57a07e8b5623ed07ff09ddcd;Needs screen rotation Because of cable I can't play it with tablet plugged in. Should have the ability to flip the screen like other apps do. It's a fun game though
57a07e8b5623ed07ff09ddce;Great Really love this game, hard but very addictive. I still cant pass lv5 vs Goo
57a07e8b5623ed07ff09ddcf;I love this game but can you make armor and weapons undegrading and allow multiplayer
57a07e8b5623ed07ff09ddd0;Grega Love the game graphics are ok and well balanced :-) .
57a07e995623ed07ff09ddd1;One of the best RPG games for mobile As an RPG player on other platforms, I can easily say that this game is brilliant
57a07e995623ed07ff09ddd2;Rogue? Cant steal items from the shop. A potion does an effect next run does another different. Sometimes the maze generator dosnt generate grey keys or stairs, not even secret doors. when you die items are drop, if you revive with an ank, you are supposed to go and take your dropped items back, nope. They dissappear.
57a07e995623ed07ff09ddd3;Too hard The difficulty is up too much,maybe add a difficulty choice?
57a07e995623ed07ff09ddd4;üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ I absolutely love it! Totally worth playing.
57a07ea65623ed07ff09ddd5;"Your 5 star rating has degraded from overuse.' Great game until item degradation was introduced. Now it's just an exercise of diminishing returns. The deeper the dungeon level, the stronger the mobs which requires a more upgraded weapon. The more upgraded a weapon, the faster it degrades. You'll quickly find your weapon broken and have no way to fix it since methods of repair are finite and monsters to fight aren't.
57a07ea65623ed07ff09ddd6;Love the game but... The degradation system was a big NO for me.
57a07ea65623ed07ff09ddd7;Great. Addictive, I can play this whole day..
57a07ea65623ed07ff09ddd8;Outstanding Game definitely 5 stars
57a07eb35623ed07ff09ddd9;Best Game One of the greatest games on Google Play. Free and without ads. The difficulty is brutal to even a seasoned veteran gamer. Even after months of playing this, I still find myself laying on level 1 sometimes!Casual players can download the other modded ones that allow you to save your progress.
57a07eb35623ed07ff09ddda;Awesome the best
57a07eb35623ed07ff09dddb;My top game The more you play the game you will discover that the items they give you are items to help on that lvl. this game it's all about skill,experience and being smart
57a07eb35623ed07ff09dddc;Really good
57a07ec05623ed07ff09dddd;Wow, I'm blown away at how well thought out and fun this game is!! A must have!!! EDIT: I hate degradation. So now I have to play Shattered Pixel Dungeon or Sprouted Pixel Dungeon. WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE GAME SO THAT PEOPLE WHO LIKED IT NOW HATE IT????
57a07ec05623ed07ff09ddde;Cool game I teally like this addictive game
57a07ec05623ed07ff09dddf;Game needs: This is a great game that me and my friends play and talk about together all the time but it would be a lot better with a multiplayer mode. So you could play with your near by friends or connect with people over Facebook or Google to play more long distance games
57a07ecd5623ed07ff09dde0;This game will make you rage quit so bad you'll play it again afterwards. It's a good game guys.
57a07ecd5623ed07ff09dde1;Beated the game Reached the door behind amulet, they were locked, said stay tuned for more features, unfortunately didn't get there another time to check
57a07ecd5623ed07ff09dde2;Love it Every new game is new adventure. Random dungeons with random scrolls and random colors of potions - my hubby and I just love this game.
57a07ecd5623ed07ff09dde3;Simple and fun This game is very well designed, with the simple pixel art, to the rpg battles, this game has to be played by anybody who like pixel and rpg.
57a07ed75623ed07ff09dde4;Incredibly addicting and enraging
57a07ed75623ed07ff09dde5;Great gameplay Bought the steam version also like yipe for android
57a07ed75623ed07ff09dde6;Keep freezing at the second boss It's OK but food management is a pain and doesn't really add anything and dungeons too small to give decent chances of OK kit by the boss levels. May try some of the variants :-)
57a07ed75623ed07ff09dde7;Very noice I like üëç üëç How much?
57a07ed75623ed07ff09dde8;5 10 if I could.
57a07f005623ed07ff09dde9;Good widgets
57a07f005623ed07ff09ddea;Not sute Like to rate a 5 but...battery usage does not match what is current. Ie...tells me to switch to flight mode and when I do....no change in status.SO. Not sure about this app.
57a07f005623ed07ff09ddeb;Simple as wanted Does what it says, unlike other apps which add lots of unneeded spam like battery saver, requiring permissions to read calls etc etc. Required permissions: 0, and I got exactly what I wanted, a number to tell me the battery status
57a07f005623ed07ff09ddec;Neat small app and accurate info. simply perfect--no more guessing my battery level or getting caught off-guard. Thanks for your work!
57a07f065623ed07ff09dded;Make the Plain Number a little bit bigger because it's small on my notification screen!!! Make the Plain Number a little bit bigger because it's small on my notification screen!!!
57a07f065623ed07ff09ddee;Best App Ever! This is probably the best battery indicator App.Simple design,shows adequate data and is not misleading like most other apps.Great work!
57a07f065623ed07ff09ddef;Simply superb This is what i was looking for
57a07f065623ed07ff09ddf0;No ads Yay , no more of this annoying ads :D
57a07f0a5623ed07ff09ddf1;Try to use
57a07f0a5623ed07ff09ddf2;This one is the one... BatteryBot Is faster to use, more simple, less fancy than others, becoming my favorite because of streamlined dependable function - 5 star for sure.
57a07f0a5623ed07ff09ddf3;Cool Awesome thanks for good battery indicator with big icon on top which is easy to see
57a07f0a5623ed07ff09ddf4;I LOVE IT, THANK YOU,üòáüòáüòáüòá

57a07f185623ed07ff09ddf8;If you run apps in the back ground you need this Great for monitoring battery. My small battery can get sucked dry quickly when I run music,GPS, and apps in the background. This widget tell me how much juice I have available at all times.

57a07f4c5623ed07ff09ddfe;Doesn't find bluetooth keyboard Doesn't report bluetooth keyboard battery status. Can not choose which bluetooth device it tracks. Shows table's battery status instead.
57a07f945623ed07ff09ddff;Great app, exactly what I needed since the battery stats have become vague and hidden deep in the settings in recent Android versions. I'll probably soon join the group of people who buy the pro app just to show my appreciation!
57a07f945623ed07ff09de00;Nice
57a07f945623ed07ff09de01;Great!!

57a080015623ed091048e503;Doesn't work. I have root. App doesn't believe. Waste of money.
57a080035623ed091048e504;An old favorite I cant use this anymore because it doesn't wait long enough after requesting root for superuser to catch and grant the request. Huge shame.
57a080085623ed091048e506;Nice, seems useful Two UI issues for me. First, there doesn't seem to be any way to sort events alphabetically. Secondly, the little 'i' buttons are very small, and right next to the invisible scroll bar (especially so in 'By Application' view with one app. expanded). This means it's hard to hit the 'i' and very easy to hit the scroll bar by mistake, and jump to somewhere completely different in the long list! Dev., you could make the 'i' nearly 2x as big and it would still fit in the existing UI, and would help! Thanks!
57a080085623ed091048e507;Used to work, doesn't work on MM any longer I've used this app for a while after buying it and it worked perfectly. With Android 6 (MM) it doesn't work since it can't see root for some reason, rendering the app useless. Please help developer :(
57a080095623ed091048e508;Great application! For Lollipop & below, wish it was updated to work on Marshmallow tho. Still 5 star even though I can't use it

57a0800a5623ed091048e50c;Better review if it worked on 5.1.1 or newer

57a080195623ed091048e528;Does the job perfect I tried a few apps to control what apps and services began after I rooted my phone, but none of them gave me the level of control this one does.
57a0801b5623ed091048e529;works as intended Seems to do fine preventing apps from starting up automatically. 1 star down since it didn't find the Carrier IQ process (IQ Agent Service) which is what I really wanted to kill (IQ starts GPS at will and logs different data). If this app could kill IQ, I would give 5 stars. If you're wondering, I downloaded "My Android Tools" to disable Carrier IQ. Haven't seen it pop up yet, and it's free (with ads).
57a0801b5623ed091048e52a;Best app for rooted phones Every rooted android needs this app. Lets you disable apps from starting up & running in background. works w/ system apps. It's like msconfig from Windows for android
57a0801b5623ed091048e52b;Crashes everytime Cm12 lollipop. Refunded.
57a0801d5623ed091048e52c;It's a must! The only thing I was missing is a listing by application, but that's available, I just did not know!!!
57a0801d5623ed091048e52d;Powerful
57a0801d5623ed091048e52e;Wonderful Very effective..
57a0801d5623ed091048e52f;Excellent It works for all apps except for services. there are better apps though.
57a0801d5623ed091048e530;Great root tool Fantastic root tool for halting unnecessary process startups. Essential to my battery-saving routine.
57a0801e5623ed091048e531;Meizu MX2
57a0801e5623ed091048e532;Does work now on N5 with LP 5.0.1.
57a0801e5623ed091048e533;Thanks Fixed New version works again s in 4.2
57a0802e5623ed091048e534;Calculator Calculator
57a0802e5623ed091048e535;Beat calculator This calculator is simply great, easy to use, beautiful interface, and easy access to every options in a blink!! Just loved it!
57a0802e5623ed091048e536;Best one. This is it.
57a0802e5623ed091048e537;Fine good one
57a0802e5623ed091048e538;Nice calculator Add cube root and power 4 root functions as well.
57a080305623ed091048e539;Great app! Really useful.....u should add the modulus function...otherwise great ..
57a080305623ed091048e53a;Best calculator app So slick, scientific via a swipe and best of all no ads.
57a080305623ed091048e53b;Useful Always use this calculator
57a080305623ed091048e53c;Efficient And Simple Excellent interface and Functionally the best in the store.
57a080305623ed091048e53d;Love it This calculator is very nice. It is very useful
57a080315623ed091048e53e;Why did they make it worse? It has less functionality than before. The layout of the right panel is really annoying and the over styling is terrible now. It was better and simpler before. Stop touching things that don't need it. I had this app because it was better looking and feeling than the built in one. Neither of those statements are true now. Getting rid of this.
57a080315623ed091048e53f;Love it It even has a floating widget option
57a080315623ed091048e540;Stock + subtle useful features This is a great class an light weight calculator app. Takes the stock Android Calc and adds a few functional extra features. I've removed the stock app for this.
57a080325623ed091048e541;Great app Very good calculator and very usefull. I recommend to add mod function too.
57a080325623ed091048e542;When switching from an app with keyboard open, this app becomes really ugly. Please close keyboard in the beginning. It is showstopper for me.
57a080325623ed091048e543;Best Cool app
57a080325623ed091048e544;Great Calculator Everything is so easy to access. Loved it
57a080325623ed091048e545;It looks simple but a little bit complicated
57a080335623ed091048e546;Rounding problem I used to love it however it has a major problem with rounding.
57a080335623ed091048e547;its my style like it :D
57a080335623ed091048e548;Does the job beautifully
57a080335623ed091048e549;Lack of simple features like memory.
57a080335623ed091048e54a;Just perfect but still needs many other functions like inverse trignometry and others... Plz add them too
57a080365623ed091048e54b;Warning! This calculator is very nice and all, but, be aware, it doesn't understand the priorities when multiplying and adding, so you need to use brackets all the time. I have wasted my nerves on my calculations because of this!
57a080365623ed091048e54c;Simple simon Very simple .........
57a080365623ed091048e54d;Love it but why In app purchase? Why is this use in app purchases?
57a080365623ed091048e54e;Best calculator I have ever used !! Keep it up
57a080365623ed091048e54f;Great The animation sliding the second page is a bit weird, but this is perfect!
57a080375623ed091048e550;Way, way, better than stock, once you swipe to find the extra options.
57a080375623ed091048e551;Nice calculating...
57a080375623ed091048e552;Useful Great useful calculator
57a080375623ed091048e553;It is very good Very good app.i like it
57a080375623ed091048e554;Calculator Nice App
57a080375623ed091048e555;Good But some button need to be in screen
57a080385623ed091048e556;Amazing, minimal but powerful calculator. 10/10 - This is what the AOSP Calculator should have been.
57a080385623ed091048e557;Slow processing This calculator is good but slow. Please fix it. Otherwise it is best.
57a080385623ed091048e558;Love it
57a080385623ed091048e559;Good Good
57a080385623ed091048e55a;Really Good one
57a080395623ed091048e55b;Awsome
57a0803b5623ed091048e55c;GREAT very yeasy to use u must dounload
57a0803b5623ed091048e55d;Stranger wouldn't understand Featured ; Intuitive ; Stable ; Anything you need :-) worth being paid for üòá
57a0803b5623ed091048e55e;I don't get why other calculators are trying to reinvent the wheel - taking the stock app and hiding away so much functionality is ingenious. That and it's mainly open source is a definite plus. One question... What does the Pro in-app purchase give?
57a0803e5623ed091048e55f;Feature rich with a sleek UI I was looking for a good replacement for the stock calculator that had more options to it, and I found it here. With no ads, an impressive host of features including graphing all efficiently compacted into an elegantly simple interface, I'd recommend this application to anyone as an upgrade to the stock calculator.
57a0803e5623ed091048e560;Recommended over the stock version because of included calculator widget.
57a0803e5623ed091048e561;Clean and simple Great looking app. I wanted to see totals while working a problem. It works great
57a0803e5623ed091048e562;One of the best
57a080405623ed091048e563;No cube under opertaion Needs to have cube under operation and a simpler UI, much simpler otherwise very good.
57a080405623ed091048e564;So nice So nice calculator
57a080405623ed091048e565;Like it &lt;3
57a080405623ed091048e566;Fantastic animation and functionality
57a080405623ed091048e567;Hands down! It may not be most feature rich, but it is powerful enough, it even comes with a function plotter. And it works on watch too!
57a080415623ed091048e568;Simple Simple but gr8, #recommended Calculator
57a080415623ed091048e569;Clean calculator. Very simple. Solution previews. No ads. Highly recommended.
57a080415623ed091048e56a;Simple, beautiful and the best.
57a080415623ed091048e56b;Nice ... Simple :)
57a080415623ed091048e56c;Good Aplication So Modern callculator
57a080435623ed091048e56d;Superb Everything you could need in a calculator, it's fully functional and easy to use, has a very useful widget. My personal favourite is it's floating mode which allows you to very quickly access a small version of the calculator on any screen. It's incredibly useful.
57a080435623ed091048e56e;customizable widget this is what i looking for!!.simple and transparent
57a080435623ed091048e56f;open source
57a080435623ed091048e570;Best Calculator app ever Only downside is doesn't have material design. Otherwise it's very functional.
57a080445623ed091048e571;Nice Super
57a080445623ed091048e572;Excellent
57a080445623ed091048e573;awesome calculator
57a080445623ed091048e574;Please give the clear button separately
57a080445623ed091048e575;Such a fun game!!!
57a080445623ed091048e576;Top notch This app is exceptional at reminding me that 2+2 does not equal 3 but 4
57a080455623ed091048e577;Decimals are not coming in big calculations
57a080455623ed091048e578;Very useful app Best calc app in the market!
57a080455623ed091048e579;5/7 Absolutely perfect, love it.
57a080455623ed091048e57a;Micromax fire 3 It's good and simple
57a080455623ed091048e57b;Nice stock-like material calculator! With graphics, cool.
57a080475623ed091048e57c;Lots of functions while keeping that material look Lots of useful stuff like the graphing. By far one of the best calculator apps
57a080475623ed091048e57d;The single best calculator app
57a080475623ed091048e57e;Better than stock Google calc Just like the Google calc except it has a history, of your calculated results, you can recall.
57a080475623ed091048e57f;Cool
57a080475623ed091048e580;Awesome This is and will always be an awesome calculator app. It may not support calculus but is suitable for most common operations.
57a080495623ed091048e581;Nice app
57a080495623ed091048e582;Excelent Can you please add a "clear all" button when you look in the history?
57a080495623ed091048e583;DOESNT HAVE EXACT VALUE When I do pie it doesn't show me the full answer which should b fixed
57a0804b5623ed091048e584;Loved it. Quite satisfactory. Minimal yet catchy design.
57a0804b5623ed091048e585;I love this app The best calculator.
57a0804b5623ed091048e586;Simply Awesome Simple, clean, ad-free... Best calculator around
57a0804b5623ed091048e587;Great. Can u add a cube root button? I use it a lot to do my geometry homework and I need different roots
57a0804b5623ed091048e588;Excellent
57a0804c5623ed091048e589;It has history.
57a0804c5623ed091048e58a;RUBBISH What nonsense is this !!!!!!
57a0804c5623ed091048e58b;Superb
57a0804c5623ed091048e58c;nice
57a0804c5623ed091048e58d;Best Best calc, better than official one
57a0804c5623ed091048e58e;How to open history
57a0804d5623ed091048e58f;Smart calculator!! Thank's, this calculator so helpfull!!
57a0804d5623ed091048e590;Best Love it...
57a0804d5623ed091048e591;EPIC Just the most epic thing on this planet. The developer is a genius.
57a0804d5623ed091048e592;Best calculator This is superb
57a0804d5623ed091048e593;Works great, although I'm only using the Wear component for quick calculations on my LG G Watch. Thanks!
57a0804f5623ed091048e594;Awesome I like how it clears the numbers
57a0804f5623ed091048e595;Best NonGoogle Google Best replacement for those of us who like Google but can't get it üòä
57a0804f5623ed091048e596;Loved it It's the best every I love it so much
57a0804f5623ed091048e597;Best so far!
57a0804f5623ed091048e598;Widget not working Widget stopped working months ago. Tried to redownload/reinstall to no avail. Widget was the only reason I had this app.
57a080515623ed091048e599;It is so amazing
57a080515623ed091048e59a;Homework helper Homework will never be the same again!
57a080515623ed091048e59b;Love it It has the same interface as the 5.1 calculator but with the features from the older calculators which were removed :) best of all it has no ads
57a080515623ed091048e59c;Interesting Google Calculator adaptation.
57a080515623ed091048e59d;Better than Stock Calculator
57a080535623ed091048e59e;Love the graphical display Best and the most simple calculator app ive used with lollipop theme.
57a080535623ed091048e59f;NiceOne Its very usefull app awesome
57a080535623ed091048e5a0;Better than my device calculator Great minimalism design
57a080535623ed091048e5a1;More functions needed!! Please add inverse trignometric, hyperbolic trigonometric (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc), natural log and all other kind of logarithmic function! Even Matrix solving would make this calculator the best calculator app!
57a080555623ed091048e5a2;Great one
57a080555623ed091048e5a3;Matrix No matrix solving panel.
57a080555623ed091048e5a4;Good Good graphics, correct answers, and very modern
57a080555623ed091048e5a5;Awesome It literally did my homework .
57a080555623ed091048e5a6;Ur new update sucks... Makes my phone stuck on home screen after using cool widget which makes it unique from the others when I drag the icon to 'X' icon and hv to restart the whole phone... The previous version would hv been a full 5 stars
57a080575623ed091048e5a7;Best calculator!! The best 3rd party calculator i've tried. Calculation history, percentage, digit grouping, and many more (y)
57a080575623ed091048e5a8;Excellent Not sure why the stock app doesn't do some of the basic things, but glad this app exists, it works great.
57a080575623ed091048e5a9;Nice Keep adding new features.
57a0805a5623ed091048e5aa;Very useful calc app, almost perfect I use this app as my daily calculator for homework and other tasks (I'm an engineering student). Great UI, fast, simple, and feels good to use. Deceptively versatile based on its seemingly simple UI. However, one improvement I would suggest is the ability to recall previous equations instead of previous answers. Many times I find myself retyping a long equation when I need to make small changes to it. Think "question focused" instead of "answer focused"
57a0805a5623ed091048e5ab;Its work very good on lg g watch urbane
57a0805d5623ed091048e5ac;Powerful and simple The matrix calculations, 2D function graphs and base change to binary and hexadecimal are a huge plus EDIT: The new version no longer supports matrix calculations
57a0805d5623ed091048e5ad;Simple app, Amazing features I love this calculator. Some may think "how can one calculator be superior to the rest?", as I once did. However, I quickly realized just how when I went in search of a calculator that is enhanced for Android Wear. This calculator is the perfect answer for my needs, with a full-featured Wear app. It is clean, simple, uncluttered and similar to the stock/AOSP calculator app. The difference is in the expanded features, which are tucked nicely behind a few simple gestures. The floating calculator is genius!!!
57a0806c5623ed091048e5ae;Perfect! Very useful and accurate!
57a0806c5623ed091048e5af;My name is, C. C. A new hot date, friends?
57a0806c5623ed091048e5b0;There are better ones out there
57a0806c5623ed091048e5b1;It worked!
57a0806c5623ed091048e5b2;No permissions Great app
57a0806c5623ed091048e5b3;Looks ok
57a0806d5623ed091048e5b4;Good Does the job well. Good calibration function.
57a0806d5623ed091048e5b5;wow Very nice
57a0806d5623ed091048e5b6;Worked, no ads! Nothing else to say.
57a0806d5623ed091048e5b7;Bubble level Quite good for what I needed
57a0806d5623ed091048e5b8;Perfect
57a0806f5623ed091048e5b9;Loaded as a lark Should probably merit 5*, but I installed it to play a bit and have not used it seriously. I am impressed by its features. Description neglects to mention a fifth side: the back. With this last, the bubble converts to a surface level that seems accurate.
57a0806f5623ed091048e5ba;Excellent app, does what it says.
57a080815623ed091048e5bb;Good one Some device have option menu,for me no have because when i press menu, it's show all application i open.. please set it to button option.. Thanks
57a080815623ed091048e5bc;Nice, but shows constant su requests from itself Every so often while debugging issues, I come across multiple lines from logcat requesting su, notifications that it has gained/lost focus, etc. It would be very useful if there was a setting to hide any lines containing the package name or uid or other app-specific identifiers (possibly disabled automatically after a crash).
57a080815623ed091048e5bd;For people without a delicated menu button Press and hold your app switch button.
57a080825623ed091048e5be;Not user friendly it needs to be updated so it could work with lollipop and above. Most newer phones DO NOT HAVE HARDWARE BUTTONS. One ‚òÖ forever
57a080825623ed091048e5bf;Nice
57a080825623ed091048e5c0;indispensable if you debug apps for a living. no idea how this isn't part of the OS!
57a080825623ed091048e5c1;The best
57a080825623ed091048e5c2;No menu button Menu buttons are Android standard at this point, bad dev practice here
57a080845623ed091048e5c3;Very useful app for developers. Only small negative is that recorded logs stop when you view them. I would like a button to stop them when desired.
57a080845623ed091048e5c4;Great app Great app
57a080845623ed091048e5c5;It's cool but... I'd suggest adding a feature to capture only a specific process individually (per app). Other than that it's very helpful indeed. I discovered and fixed many FCs in various apps using Catlog.
57a080845623ed091048e5c6;Useful in the time of need
57a080855623ed091048e5c7;Great app but how do i save logs with no touch menu buttons on galaxy s5?
57a080855623ed091048e5c8;Material Design please.
57a080855623ed091048e5c9;Works but issues Everything works as intended, except when you scroll the text becomes distorted and flashes oddly. Needs to be redone.
57a080855623ed091048e5ca;Glitches when scrolling on marshmallow
57a080855623ed091048e5cb;Thanks! Helps a ton with development!
57a080875623ed091048e5cc;Amazing This app helped me a lot. Allowed me to see why my apps crashed so I could fix the bugs. Good job. :)
57a080875623ed091048e5cd;Why no custom default location to save log file Like other log apps, this also does not have option to set a folder to save all log files.
57a080875623ed091048e5ce;THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORT! THIS APP ISN'T SUPPORTED ANYMORE! use MatLog instead!
57a080875623ed091048e5cf;great
57a080875623ed091048e5d0;Amazing
57a080895623ed091048e5d1;Cannot share the logs. The 3 dot menu opens the RECENT MENU. Help!
57a080895623ed091048e5d2;Good
57a080895623ed091048e5d3;It works as stated in that you can see catch any random force close when trying to figure out an issue, however it seems dev needs to code the menu button for lollipop up. Seems only coded for dedicated hardware button and not soft keys. The 3 dot menu option is not available. This essentially makes the tool useless to me as I need to extract and email the logs. Dev please update app
57a080895623ed091048e5d4;Nice Great app. Does what you need, simple as that.
57a0808b5623ed091048e5d5;No useful log It shows only log about touch and scroll the listview, I did not see any other log
57a0808b5623ed091048e5d6;Bug Maybe its just me, but the catlog does not display anything... It was working before but on cm13 the circle just keeps rotating like it can't find anything... Any idea? :)
57a0808b5623ed091048e5d7;Marshmallow ready? Doesn't seem to play well with cm13... Love it for anything else!
57a0808b5623ed091048e5d8;Works unrooted on Android 5.1, correct adb command is: pm grant com.nolanlawson.logcat android.permission.READ_LOGS
57a0808c5623ed091048e5d9;Yup Good at pouncing bugs.
57a0808c5623ed091048e5da;Unrivaled, best of it's own kind
57a0808c5623ed091048e5db;Can't access menus. I can't access the menus at all so this app is of little use to me.
57a0808c5623ed091048e5dc;Woohoo! Helped me find what was causing a super annoying system ui crash!
57a0808c5623ed091048e5dd;Simple and does the job
57a0808e5623ed091048e5de;Terrible Said my device tablet had to be rooted n it would only see the catlogs of the app itself.
57a0808e5623ed091048e5df;Best For troubleshooting issues.
57a0808e5623ed091048e5e0;There's no way top save the logs. The dev likely coded the menu function for phones with a dedicated capacitive menu button.
57a0808e5623ed091048e5e1;Ok Ok
57a0808e5623ed091048e5e2;The best I don't use anything else
57a080905623ed091048e5e3;pretty good but I cannot open log file in logcat. I liked the way log is displayed in this app but I can't view the file in it. Also the pause button stops working if try to open file.
57a080905623ed091048e5e4;Top app For info (in case dev not already aware!), there is a graphical glitch when scrolling output in marshmallow on a nexus 5:)
57a080905623ed091048e5e5;Meow meow Very useful if you want to debug and troubleshoot something that is wrong with your device
57a080905623ed091048e5e6;It's okay Not too user friendly
57a080925623ed091048e5e7;Clone of debugger for android? One of you copied the other. Whoever really made this app should report the other to google because its probably malware.
57a080925623ed091048e5e8;Thank you loran
57a080925623ed091048e5e9;Very useful but... I wish there was a way to filter logs by error level (warning, info, debug etc)...
57a080925623ed091048e5ea;The best, but... Please, for the sake of all of the earth's inhabitants, change the ui and app icon.
57a080925623ed091048e5eb;Menu key No way to access menu key
57a080955623ed091048e5ec;Scrolling gets hijacked Good app, but when i scroll up to read previous logs during live view, it autoscrolls away from what I'm reading, causing me to lose my place.
57a080955623ed091048e5ed;Useful app For when you're not at your computer and a small bug is nagging you.
57a080955623ed091048e5ee;Useful Useful, but it get weird rendering issues while scrolling. Glyphs remain in place while also moving so the screen becomes unreadable until I stop scrolling. Look into hardware/software rendering plz.
57a080955623ed091048e5ef;How to How do you recorded plz help
57a080985623ed091048e5f0;Works Nice
57a080985623ed091048e5f1;If there's an ability to save to a file, it's so well hidden that it might as well not be there. When the app started, it said something about a widget, but that's all I ever saw about it other than being mentioned in the Play Store. This program is useless as delivered, since there's no way to get the logs off the device - holding my finger on the screen popped up an option to copy to the clipboard, but that was one line only. tested on Samsung Tab S with Android 5.0.2
57a080985623ed091048e5f2;Superb
57a080985623ed091048e5f3;Working very well Tried a lot many apps but this one works excellently.
57a0809a5623ed091048e5f4;Good but... Sometimes hang on filter screen. Also, app need to use new Android navigation method instead of menu key as this key is obsolete in newer Android devices.
57a0809a5623ed091048e5f5;Super good. Just need UI update (Material?).
57a0809a5623ed091048e5f6;Great! Very easy to use, many features of it, thanks!
57a0809a5623ed091048e5f7;Nice app. Not compatable with Lollipop? Cant seem to access the menus without the hardware menu button.
57a0809c5623ed091048e5f8;It works without root after enabling the READ_LOGS permission for it, using adb: `pm grant org.jtb.alogcat android.permission.READ_LOGS` and restarting the app. This is needed on the newer Android versions. Please update the description to get one more start.
57a0809c5623ed091048e5f9;Root access How do i get the root access? :/
57a0809c5623ed091048e5fa;A good app for android developer
57a0809c5623ed091048e5fb;Only understand if u r developer
57a0809c5623ed091048e5fc;Great Great
57a0809e5623ed091048e5fd;Functional but UI is stuck in Gingerbread era and it still requires use of menu button to access option.
57a0809e5623ed091048e5fe;Wonderful I have searched for this for long
57a0809e5623ed091048e5ff;Root access If your app need root access, you should have said so in the description!
57a0809e5623ed091048e600;Somewhat limited but does the job Can search in messages, yay, but can't exclude tags, can't search for specific tags. Try searching for the tag "cm" - it find a million tags that *contain* the letters.
57a0809e5623ed091048e601;Save my day Thank you guys!
57a080a05623ed091048e602;A must have
57a080a05623ed091048e603;How to operate it? How the program obtain root acces? Get confuse
57a080a05623ed091048e604;internet love cats so why the fuck not
57a080a05623ed091048e605;Great app Saved me so much time debugging my apps. Wish it wouldn't require root. I have root on my phone but not all the devices I test on.
57a080a05623ed091048e606;Great .. i use this to catch rogue apps and fine tuning, works great
57a080a35623ed091048e607;Root
57a080a35623ed091048e608;Bug report made easy Easily share logs online with you custom rom.dev and fix whatever problem your having. .
57a080a35623ed091048e609;Simples Just Works (tm)
57a080a35623ed091048e60a;Meow Meow
57a080a55623ed091048e60b;It works. Requires root access to debug other apps.
57a080a55623ed091048e60c;Needs root
57a080a55623ed091048e60d;great app but.. it took be about a week to figure out how to open up the menu on the device..ugh
57a080a55623ed091048e60e;Help!! I don't understand what is it?? What are working it?? Plz reply my review..
57a080a55623ed091048e60f;Stop looking elsewhere Of the logcat apps I've used, this is the best; line numbering, highlighting, filtering logs, saved output... definitely worth the donation.
57a080a65623ed091048e610;thanks to this app
57a080a65623ed091048e611;Amazing work. Was looking for something like this for a long time to debug my app.
57a080a65623ed091048e612;One of the apps you need. Not needing a log viewer is the only valid reason for not having CatLog.
57a080a65623ed091048e613;The app for the job. Nuff said.
57a080a65623ed091048e614;Great It is using root user. No other apps do that.
57a080a75623ed091048e615;Catalog reader This app is the tell-tell, jigs. Luuuuv it.
57a080a75623ed091048e616;THE Log App Does everything you need with a simple interface. Filter, search, record, save, send the log... Etc.
57a080a75623ed091048e617;üêÅThank you very many! üòâ
57a080a75623ed091048e618;Works, but looks ancient. The design is from pre-Holo times.
57a080a75623ed091048e619;Extremely useful Thank you for an excellent app!
57a080a85623ed091048e61a;Needa only material design update
57a080b85623ed091048e61b;Likefull
57a080b85623ed091048e61c;Useful app One of the most usable and must have app for your smartphone.
57a080b85623ed091048e61d;Best Tool Must have for people who wants to know about network connectivity, would love to see AFWall+ integration :)
57a080b85623ed091048e61e;Omfg perfect Recommend for all android users.
57a080b85623ed091048e61f;great, but something sometimes wents wrong and app is crashing every startup, sometimes is stable and useful
57a080ba5623ed091048e620;Requires root access
57a080ba5623ed091048e621;This app helped me diagnose a recent problem that I had on my phone: Every time my phone reboots it downloaded several hundreds of MBs, on Wifi as well as on data. After diagnosing the problem I was able to download a firewall and block the data-hungry processes when on data. Thanks developer! It's amazing that this app is for free! :)
57a080ba5623ed091048e622;It actually worked! First logger that worked on my phone. Was actually easy to use and gave me the details I needed. Can't comment beyond that. Thanks.
57a080ba5623ed091048e623;Good one.
57a080bc5623ed091048e624;Did not work üôÑ (yes I have root)
57a080bc5623ed091048e625;Will only be Six Stars if 1) Why root? I think the same app with the same UI can be done using the internal VPN tunnel technique. 2) adding possibility of reading the contents of the packets. 3) decryption of the packet using SSL certificates. However, this app is the best so far in showing data flow of traffic and per packet analysis.
57a080bc5623ed091048e626;didnt work with cm13
57a080bc5623ed091048e627;App doesn't work says it needs root access It sure would have been helpful if the author had specified that the app requires root access
57a080be5623ed091048e628;I Like it . But is there a support forum?. Its a good app that does what it says it will. Let's you see what your firewall is not blocking. I would add a feature to consolidate entries to and from the same IP address. The log files are too cumbersome.even a five minute log takes for ever to scroll through.
57a080be5623ed091048e629;So far, awesome Logging, flexible graphs and filtering. Source code. Cool!
57a080be5623ed091048e62a;wow
57a080be5623ed091048e62b;I love this app!!! This is exactly what everyone needs installed to keep track of what apps are stealing your data and personal info. I found a somewhat 'legitimate' app making remote connections to their personal DSL IP in NY, hmmm that shouldn't be happening
57a080bf5623ed091048e62c;Sweet! This is exactly what I been looking for. Thanks Dev!
57a080bf5623ed091048e62d;Great app ! Extremely useful, specially when you need network usage info without wanting to go down to packet sniffing level. Thanks dev for the good work !
57a080cf5623ed091048e62e;Unable to explore Explore option is not working probably disabled
57a080cf5623ed091048e62f;Works great, looks great and customer service is great too :-)
57a080cf5623ed091048e630;Private repos not shown The reply from developer didn't help, as I don't find private filter in the filter list. Also I find the app doesn't remember username and password so every time I need to type in password again.
57a080d05623ed091048e631;Really really cool!!! Love it too much!!!!!!!!
57a080d05623ed091048e632;Better than the official It's better than the official, at least last time I checked. Its syntax highlighting still doesn't handle VB comments. Oh, well. I don't like VB anyhow.
57a080d05623ed091048e633;Excellent GitHub Client! It has everything that I need!
57a088db5623ed0942ed7c67;Perfect! Simpke, reliable, safe - exact what I need.
57a088db5623ed0942ed7c68;Great app, finaly a little security!
57a088db5623ed0942ed7c69;Works seamlessly with Android 6 Please add the word count as U R typing. Also, how can we be sure that the encryption is actually working? We have no way of confirming this, only the developer's words of assurance. Is the source code 'open' or 'closed' ? Thanks for what appears to be an excellent app.
57a088db5623ed0942ed7c6a;Aviator Excellent app , secure, safe , and elegant . Chats and Crystal clear calls, good luck Signal Team , keep going !!
57a088dd5623ed0942ed7c6b;Simply Great I have tried multiple different texting apps and this is far and away the best. Simple, appealing, and functional all at once.
57a088dd5623ed0942ed7c6c;Still too buggy to be default I like it, but it's still a little too buggy to be my default SMS app. E.g MMS messages don't render the image you're trying to send, and "sharing to SMS" seems to have random behavior.
57a088dd5623ed0942ed7c6d;Amazing Download now
57a088dd5623ed0942ed7c6e;Signal Awesome application
57a088dd5623ed0942ed7c6f;It works See above lol
57a088df5623ed0942ed7c70;When I use Google Now voice command to compose and send a text message, the text doesn't show up in the conversation in the app. App doesn't contain enough features such as "Seen‚úÖ/Read" or Android 6.0 fingerprint integration to lock the app.
57a088df5623ed0942ed7c71;Works nice!
57a088df5623ed0942ed7c72;ÿπÿßŸÑ€å ÿÆ€åŸÑ€å ÿÆŸàÿ® *****
57a088df5623ed0942ed7c73;Dope!
57a088e15623ed0942ed7c74;Not able to register on the network tried , tried several WiFi connections, tried again still receive the error not able to register, thanks for the response I was able to get registered
57a088e15623ed0942ed7c75;Enjoying it Working very well
57a088e15623ed0942ed7c76;Simply secure, Signal is world class encryption in an user friendly package.
57a088e25623ed0942ed7c77;Great app Clean and easy to use
57a088e45623ed0942ed7c78;Great app, minor bug fix needed. The attachment feature to add your location link via Google maps does not always work properly. You choose the location, it places the picture and link in the text area, but it does not allow you to send. If you type into the text box, it will send the text but not the map link.
57a088e45623ed0942ed7c79;Everyone should switch to Signal! Encrypted & No ads? Really?! Best messenger feeling ever!

57a088e45623ed0942ed7c7b;Rapido Loa mensajes funcionan rapidamente... tienen que mejorar el multimedia
57a088e75623ed0942ed7c7c;Can't set up as default in MIUI 7.5 On MIUI 7.5 although it's set up as default for sms, the standard app is getting used instead.
57a088e75623ed0942ed7c7d;Easy to Use Encryption I favored the ability of the app to reproduce the standard messenger app. It can effortlessly switch back and forth from sending both encrypted and unencrypted data packets. Note: In order to send a truly encrypted packet the recipient also needs to have the Signal app.
57a088e75623ed0942ed7c7e;It's nice! It's nice and become amazing if it adds an option of transferring PDF files as well :D
57a088e75623ed0942ed7c7f;Best messenging app If you want a full featured, free and open source secure app, use this.
57a088ea5623ed0942ed7c80;(((Very Consume battery!!! ))) Please check Telegram and whatsapp very late to update??? very Very slow and poor Too much time late to Download video?(Iran and Indonesia) I have Galaxy note 4 Android 6.0.1 Internet 4G LTE please fixed and update
57a088ea5623ed0942ed7c81;Perfect I've replaced it with my native SMS app and also whatsapp.
57a088ea5623ed0942ed7c82;Great interface.
57a088ea5623ed0942ed7c83;Awesome Super dank!
57a088ea5623ed0942ed7c84;Easy to use Everybody should use this. Very easy to use
57a088eb5623ed0942ed7c85;Great App for My Purposes It's a bit Spartan for some, but it performs very well for me.
57a088eb5623ed0942ed7c86;Really cool Love it. Do you all intend to implement a scheduled messages feature? (sending messages at a scheduled time). Solid app.
57a088eb5623ed0942ed7c87;Text message replacement Secure, easy, all in one text message replacement. Calls are not as clear as regular phone calls but good.
57a088eb5623ed0942ed7c88;Great App for Lollipop. Great app. Get your friends on board!
57a088eb5623ed0942ed7c89;Bikeluv12 Great
57a088ed5623ed0942ed7c8a;One annoying little thing... Works absolutely great, except when you make a voice call, it plays a gong sound upon connection at volume 11. All our calls begin, "Hello? Ouch! Damnit! Why? Why do they play that deafening tone right in my ear?" Turn off that 'feature' for 5 stars.
57a088ed5623ed0942ed7c8b;Change of settings Allow us to change the color of the contacts
57a088ed5623ed0942ed7c8c;Great app Its easy to use, and had cool themes
57a088ed5623ed0942ed7c8d;Good Good
57a088ee5623ed0942ed7c8e;Secure but not very private
57a088f05623ed0942ed7c8f;The most secure app we have found! This app does exactly what it says it will. Full featured and it's free! Not bogged down with malware or other crap either. This group did it and did it right!
57a088f05623ed0942ed7c90;Amazing Just wish it was easier to share contact cards.
57a088f05623ed0942ed7c91;Works great Encrypt all the things
57a088f05623ed0942ed7c92;Great for texting Simple and clean. üëå
57a088f05623ed0942ed7c93;Love it Definitely an awesome app
57a088f25623ed0942ed7c94;Great app Does everything I need it to, easy to use, you can personalize cors and tones, best one I've used
57a088f25623ed0942ed7c95;Works as advertised
57a088f25623ed0942ed7c96;Works As Advertised Try it for yourselves to see :)
57a088f25623ed0942ed7c97;Great except the screen shot Works great except the app won't allow screen shots.
57a088f25623ed0942ed7c98;Best in safety Best in class
57a088f65623ed0942ed7c99;Great app Works well and didn't use much memory
57a088f65623ed0942ed7c9a;Solid ap Since Australia's ridiculous Data Retention laws came in, this has been a great way to give the finger to the Bull$hit laws. Works well, probably even better than that standard Android or HTC one.
57a088f65623ed0942ed7c9b;Fast and accurate and private! Signal Messaging
57a088f65623ed0942ed7c9c;Awesome app
57a088f65623ed0942ed7c9d;Awesome!
57a088f85623ed0942ed7c9e;It is awesome Awesome if both sides of the conversation have this app. Would be nice if it worked under ultra power saving.
57a088f85623ed0942ed7c9f;Good app but... It would be nice to be able to send longer text messages. I used to be able to longer messages, so I don't know why it changed.
57a088f85623ed0942ed7ca0;Great Love it, great and easy to use
57a088f85623ed0942ed7ca1;Great app Friend said to try. Like the "secure" call feature. Not sure how encrypted it is but it works great on my LG V10.
57a088fa5623ed0942ed7ca2;Encrypted and Edward Snowden approved Do I really need to say more?
57a088fa5623ed0942ed7ca3;Can't use at all Just activated it but am unable to send ANY type of messages. It doesn't even let me delete old ones. Am i doing something wrong?
57a088fa5623ed0942ed7ca4;I like the app, but it wont let me share pictures when im connected tp wifiüòï
57a088fa5623ed0942ed7ca5;Great app
57a088fa5623ed0942ed7ca6;Great app
57a088fd5623ed0942ed7ca7;Switched to straightalk and this saved me Switching to straightalk, att killed my messaging service, I couldn't send mms or pics anymore. This program worked around their settings and now I can do anything I could do on att, but at a third of the cost.
57a088fd5623ed0942ed7ca8;Works but simple Does not fully exploit mms and sms, but works for txt. Does not work well for calls unless full 4G.
57a088fd5623ed0942ed7ca9;Amazing App but Attachments won't open on Android N Amazing App, use everyday however attachments don't open when selecting on Android N
57a088fe5623ed0942ed7caa;I like it I'm surprised it doesn't support fingerprint locking. A call log could also be handy. Share documents missing. I'll have a look to the source code :)
57a088fe5623ed0942ed7cab;Freedom at last My comms are protected here. Hallelujah.
57a088fe5623ed0942ed7cac;Excellent
57a088fe5623ed0942ed7cad;Just what I needed This is what I needed to share confidential info with others. Thank You.
57a089025623ed0942ed7cae;Security really doesn't get easier So easy to use. Simple and intuitive. There really is no effort into configuration or anything, and you have the ability to have secure chat and messaging. It has replaced Hangouts for me. My only complaint is the 5 MB gif limit. Would love it to be 10 MB, which is what Hangouts supports, but it's hardly a deal breaker.
57a089025623ed0942ed7caf;One issue Sometimes messages won't send over WiFi, other than that it's pretty good.
57a089025623ed0942ed7cb0;Needs better group management. Great app for security, but I hate how you have to create a new group to send a group message and then there is no way to remove someone from the group once you start a group text. Please catch up on group management features.
57a089045623ed0942ed7cb1;It's fine and straightforward Nothing particularly extraordinary and I find it easy to use, I have a friend who prefers the security and I like the idea.
57a089045623ed0942ed7cb2;Most secure, but dated UI. Works great! Would love a visual refresh.. The dark theme is too black.. Maybe more controls with text size and layout, etc.. Possibly some nicer animations, etc.. But in the end, it does what it needs to, and does it well.
57a089045623ed0942ed7cb3;FOSS, what's not to love? Signal is the best end-to-end encryption messaging app out there. The fact that it's based on FOSS rather than proprietary technology makes it even better.
57a089075623ed0942ed7cb4;The best encrypted texting app Works for people who also don't have it..
57a089075623ed0942ed7cb5;Hard to authenticate on Google voice Should have the option to manually enter code and the option to call instead of text right from the get go instead of after failure
57a089075623ed0942ed7cb6;Please add 1 feature. I need the ability to intentionally send a regular non secure sms. If I text securely with someone, then they lose data or wifi, they won't receive my texts. PLEASE.
57a089095623ed0942ed7cb7;Great App, Ugly Smiley Face Emoticons. Whats up with the creepy looking smiley faces ? Whoever is in charge of that, has a dark side for sure.
57a089095623ed0942ed7cb8;Uninstall issues If you are writing another signal user and they decide to stop using the app then they MUST unregister otherwise they don't receive your texts. This is a big bug. There is no feedback that they aren't using the app and that you may not get texts from them.
57a089095623ed0942ed7cb9;It's ok
57a0890d5623ed0942ed7cba;*Update* Its good, can't copy down a thread if you need to, but it is very good on key encryption. &lt;= older version. *Update* Have grown used to this minor update. Encryption from Textsecure to Signal doesn't seem much different, so most of its merits is on being a minimally invasive text messaging app, which compared to some others is ok. Attaching pics, docs, graphics not as smooth as it should be. The app modifies the emoticons depending on the phone/os its on (test that out recently), and spell check nonexiste
57a0890d5623ed0942ed7cbb;Signal Love it! Just wish that Google would read the text messages from Signal and not just from Google Messages!
57a0890d5623ed0942ed7cbc;Great messaging app! Super happy that more of my friends are using Signal.
57a0890e5623ed0942ed7cbd;Even desktop support The best encrypted messenger for now!
57a0890e5623ed0942ed7cbe;Really Slick Amazing app. Clean, functional and versatile. Waiting for native on desktop.
57a0890e5623ed0942ed7cbf;Allways great Very pleasing to use and worth to spread!
57a0890e5623ed0942ed7cc0;My favorite
57a0890e5623ed0942ed7cc1;Is this end2end or p2p messenger? P2p network never supports offline messages
57a089105623ed0942ed7cc2;See the comment below
57a089105623ed0942ed7cc3;Best encryption app. Loved it! Highly recommend.
57a089105623ed0942ed7cc4;Great app Be sure to check your keys with the recipients to ensure there is not a MITM
57a089105623ed0942ed7cc5;Only if... I'm sure I would love it if I could get it to register. It never connects to the server. It's probably a CyanogenMod text secure server issue but who knows.
57a089115623ed0942ed7cc6;Safe & Fast It's really fast and voice call quality is good. Recommended for everyone. Unfortunately it's blocked in Iran and not working anymore.
57a089115623ed0942ed7cc7;Awesome! Great app, great security, great features
57a089115623ed0942ed7cc8;Simple, good messaging app
57a089115623ed0942ed7cc9;Great replacement Great secure replacement for standard texting app, fast and stable
57a089155623ed0942ed7cca;Not quite there on Android Nougat It‚Äôs great that someone cares about privacy, but in terms of actual usability, it‚Äôs not quite there, at least on the DP5 Android Nougat. Most of my communications are done in group chats, none of which were imported from the default Messenger app. When i try to tap the attach button in any thread, Signal becomes completely unresponsive. Kind of a bummer, I hope this gets fixed.
57a089155623ed0942ed7ccb;Great app
57a089155623ed0942ed7ccc;Fantastic and clean Love this app. It is the only app I will use and I use it as default text app too. Just simple and works.
57a089165623ed0942ed7ccd;Great App Security in this day and age from an SMS/MMS app is priceless. For added security reinitialize the session every few months
57a089165623ed0942ed7cce;Need app I love this app
57a089165623ed0942ed7ccf;Easy installation
57a089165623ed0942ed7cd0;Blocked I love it but it's now blocked in Iran... What should we do? Can you solve this problem or we have to use an unsecure VPN?
57a089165623ed0942ed7cd1;Best
57a089185623ed0942ed7cd2;Good One! Need swipe functions to delete messages...
57a089185623ed0942ed7cd3;Finally something privacy centric to sink my teeth into Brilliantly secure and user centric.
57a089185623ed0942ed7cd4;Secure but that's it Whatsapp is a far better platform in terms of reliability and user friendliness
57a089185623ed0942ed7cd5;Love this app. Its fast easy to use. The best part is that it's simple, responsive and isn't a resource hog.
57a089185623ed0942ed7cd6;Stable n Secure Now my family and I can text one another with the minds at ease.
57a0891a5623ed0942ed7cd7;App Has A Virus In It
57a0891a5623ed0942ed7cd8;Must have Using an LG G3 in Canada. The stock sms messaging app lags like a mf'er when the other person is responding. This app took away that annoyance and handles messages in/out like a champ. The bonus is the way it handles your camera.
57a0891a5623ed0942ed7cd9;best encrypted messaging app there is.
57a0891a5623ed0942ed7cda;Simple and effective I have nothing to hide, but I love the UI of this message app.
57a0891f5623ed0942ed7cdb;Notifications could use a slight update I love this app, and would love to give it five stars, except it is lacking the major feature I look for in a messaging app. I have the s7 edge, and I like when I can lay my phone face down, and the edges light up. This app does not do that. If it did, 5 stars all the way.
57a0891f5623ed0942ed7cdc;Awesome Great interface and rockstar security.
57a0891f5623ed0942ed7cdd;Works great Just wish more people used it
57a0891f5623ed0942ed7cde;Excellent!
57a089215623ed0942ed7cdf;Good app for security but... My draft messages keep disappearing. Is really frustrating and not good enough.
57a089215623ed0942ed7ce0;Awesome Best secure VoIP for android
57a089215623ed0942ed7ce1;Secure & easy to use Can recommend it. Also, pressing enter sends the text :-D
57a089215623ed0942ed7ce2;Safest Messaging App Signal continues to deliver the safest mobile messaging experience in the post-Snowden era, without compromising on usability or features.
57a089245623ed0942ed7ce3;Good but missing SMS and GSM Call end-to-end encryption Great that a desktop app is being created but what of the non-chrome users / google haters?
57a089245623ed0942ed7ce4;Epic!
57a089245623ed0942ed7ce5;More than just security If this app was just a watered down text app with more encryption, I would not use it. But in addition to it's amazing security features, it has a great and functional UI that works well with the other built in features on my phone. It's better than my factory installed SMS app by far.
57a089275623ed0942ed7ce6;Improved! Tried the shop about a year ago, and had problems. But now it seems to be working pretty well. The one thing is that I don't get a notification on every text. It tends to only make the notification sound when I'm already in the app. Not sure if that's a phone setting somewhere that I can't find or...?
57a089275623ed0942ed7ce7;Pros: It is a clean user interface. It uses end to end encryption by default. There is a Chrome web store application that works with it. It works well with your existing contacts list. Cons: Frequently posts messages anywhere from 3-15 times in a row. There is no way to remove a person from a group or completely delete a group. The only option is for everyone to leave the group message and create another, without the person you wanted to remove. Seems to be more problematic with iOS devices, especially after doing a reinstallation.
57a089295623ed0942ed7ce8;Awesome! Haven't had any complaints.
57a089295623ed0942ed7ce9;Only flaw Only flaw is to make your friends use it when they dont care about encryption....
57a089295623ed0942ed7cea;shheeetttt well al be
57a089295623ed0942ed7ceb;Excellent Integration I love that I can send regular sms messages from the app as well as hypersecure elite hacker messages and calls
57a0892b5623ed0942ed7cec;Great, secure messaging app! I recommended this app to all my friends, this is a great looking, highly functional, and secure app. I really recommend it to literally anyone, even if you aren't interested in security.
57a0892b5623ed0942ed7ced;Very good Very good app
57a0892b5623ed0942ed7cee;Good design, esthetics Could some more interoperability, and more user friendly UI in navigating and creating groups and user management
57a0892b5623ed0942ed7cef;Awesome Easy to use and nothing is confusing straight forward
57a0892d5623ed0942ed7cf0;Nice Ok
57a0892d5623ed0942ed7cf1;Privacy First! Electronic Privacy is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The folks at Open Whisper provided a pivotal comtribution with signal.
57a0892d5623ed0942ed7cf2;Very good, but... It is a pain trying to get family and friends to convert. You should make so our Facebook and Google friends can text securely with us on signal too.
57a0892f5623ed0942ed7cf3;Should be default on Nexus cellphones Only issue: search/find function for messages does not work. Clean material design, very stable and awesome integration with iOS Signal. Moxie and his team have developed the most secure app on the planet. Google should make this messaging app the default SMS/MMS/IM app on Nexus mobiles. Encourage your colleagues, friends and family to use this app. You will not be disappointed. Signal is the iMessage version for Android and iOS but much more secure. A must have SMS/MMS/IM app.
57a0892f5623ed0942ed7cf4;Good security
57a0892f5623ed0942ed7cf5;Everytime I try to add an attachment to my text the app crashes...

57a089315623ed0942ed7cf9;repeatedly resends text Used to work, now it repeatedly resends the same text
57a089345623ed0942ed7cfa;Great app! But no SIM, not work? Messages arrive (& go out) pretty slow (delay). And once registered with SMS verification, should be able to operate without requiring SIM, no? Will have to discontinue due to this limitation! My trusted good old Nexus 4 heats up pretty bad with a SIM in it, so I use my other dual SIM phone. Too bad, Signal...
57a089345623ed0942ed7cfb;Best Secure SMS App on the Market
57a089345623ed0942ed7cfc;Security without the hassle Great interface and simple to use. The end to end encryption is great and you don't have to worry about it. One of the best message apps out there even without encryption.
57a089365623ed0942ed7cfd;Signal app Does exactly what it says it will. Requires the other contact to have the app for encryption to occur. Still very easy to use, and I can't fault it really. Even has a function to 'invite' people to get the app, without being invasive or demanding.
57a089365623ed0942ed7cfe;Encryption is key Everyone should use it!
57a089365623ed0942ed7cff;Great app
57a089365623ed0942ed7d00;Secure & Private I found the voice volume a little down. That's the only issue I found. It works better than whatsapp and telegram I feel.

57a0893b5623ed0942ed7d02;Polished and easy to use.
57a0893b5623ed0942ed7d03;Nice App Excellent app, 4 stars because everything can always be improved!
57a0893b5623ed0942ed7d04;Works pretty well. Doing group messages takes some work. Mms does not always come thru on Wi-Fi. Getting better though
57a0893f5623ed0942ed7d05;ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤
57a0893f5623ed0942ed7d06;Easy encryption Good general purpose messaging and encryption that is as effortless as it should be.
57a089445623ed0942ed7d07;Great Love the safety of this, excellent app.
57a089445623ed0942ed7d08;Secure, simple, and effective app Only complaint is that it isnt the standard messaging and calling protocol for all cellular devices and tablets. Great app, wish everyone used! *If you use skype on your pc, try Tox.im (its encrypted and decentralized video and text program similar to skype) for android there is ¬µTox (utox) but it is still experimental and I havent used it but read the touch settings are not properly configured
57a089445623ed0942ed7d09;Does Not work, unreliable, messages might not arrive, sucks!
57a089445623ed0942ed7d0a;Return to privacy
57a089455623ed0942ed7d0b;Best app ever
57a089455623ed0942ed7d0c;Love it but... There's something wrong with the decryption. All incoming texts say, "Be sure to drink your Ovaltine."
57a089455623ed0942ed7d0d;More people should use this. Like IMessage for Android. This is the messaging app that everyone should have by default.
57a089455623ed0942ed7d0e;A little slow now and then but the messaging is amazing. A few bugs but definitely worth the download
57a089475623ed0942ed7d0f;Great! All it needs is updated emojis. Other than that it works wonders! Split view support would be ideal
57a089475623ed0942ed7d10;Cool app
57a089475623ed0942ed7d11;Easy and awesome No issues yet and I've been using for almost a year. I know when I'm sending a secure message vs a regular unsecured text. The app can prevent screenshots and downloading pictures. Love the features and its super easy to use.
57a089475623ed0942ed7d12;The best unfortunately it's block in iran!
57a089495623ed0942ed7d13;Best encrypted messenger app! I have been using signal ever since it came out. This is the most secure messaging app out on the market. Your messages are encrypted and secure. For those of you curious this app will also handle SMS but won't be encrypted unless the other party has signal installed. As the ap states you can make encrypted calls. To get the most out of the app, exercise security minded habits. I have had no issues with this app. Thank you moxie Marlinspike for a great app!
57a089495623ed0942ed7d14;Beastly I ALWAYS invite my friends. My favorite feature is the seemless integration with standard text to non users too. Please allow bigger file transfers.
57a0894b5623ed0942ed7d15;Works for awhile Keeps crashing all the time, message says Signal has stopped working, then gives me the option of reporting crashes .......... C'mon fix this glaring issue associated with the last update.
57a0894b5623ed0942ed7d16;Really good! Very simplistic but that's the best kind of App. Does what is advertised. Nothing more nothing less.
57a0894b5623ed0942ed7d17;Use this app for texting.
57a0894b5623ed0942ed7d18;Almost perfect Everything works great. All I need more is dual sim card support.
57a0894e5623ed0942ed7d19;Easy and simple Does what it is supposed to do.

57a0894e5623ed0942ed7d1b;My Daily SMS App After trying Go SMS, Textra, hangouts, etc., I was frustrated with their ability to find contacts to start a new message rapidly from over 1000+ contacts. Signal has been the only app that can handle the search almost instantly. Because of that, it is my daily SMS app. I don't have any friends that use it so haven't had the chance to try the encryption. Looking forward to continuing to use it. Would love it even more if it had delivery and read receipts.
57a0894e5623ed0942ed7d1c;best
57a089505623ed0942ed7d1d;Good Need some more features like online status and messages seen indication.
57a089505623ed0942ed7d1e;Been great so far It is a light weight smooth and effective app. Only downside is that the voip audio could be a bit louder.
57a089505623ed0942ed7d1f;Signal to signal texting not reliable It seems to require internet for signal to signal texting, and I'm not sure why. Message gets delayed if not connected to internet when sending a text to another Signal user
57a089505623ed0942ed7d20;Can't create messages on ZTE phone Works great on every other phone I have used
57a089525623ed0942ed7d21;Easy to use, secure messaging.
57a089525623ed0942ed7d22;Great app. Drops calls when moving on and off Wi-Fi and does funny things to Bluetooth headphones which would have driven me to three stars except it is so great when it works that 5 it is
57a089525623ed0942ed7d23;Connectivity Doesnt connect
57a089525623ed0942ed7d24;Great
57a089555623ed0942ed7d25;Wish the phone call can be more clear a day stable. The phone calls I can receive and dial out through WhatsApp can not through signal. It has only shown that I have missed phone calls but no ring tone. Neither when i'vd tried to call back.
57a089555623ed0942ed7d26;Secure across devices I chose to use this app because of the security it offered. I love it because it was easy to install, it's easy to use, and I can use it on my laptop as well as on my phone.
57a089555623ed0942ed7d27;Yeah this is great
57a089555623ed0942ed7d28;Really slick and minimal I really appreciate the e-2-e encryption. Would looooooooove swipe to delete a thread though.
57a089575623ed0942ed7d29;I love it Very useful app thank you guys recommend to everyone

57a089585623ed0942ed7d2e;Its our conversation..not theirs. If you have encryption why not use it?
57a089635623ed0942ed7d2f;Two-Step Verification is EXTREMELY VITAL Please add two step verification like in Telegram or Protonmail, this is EXTREMELY VITAL for countries with oppressive regime (Russia, Iran,Turkey etc ) where authorities can easily intercept and use your verification SMS to hijack your account, this is very popular among special services ( 5 attemps of Telegram hijacking using Russia's biggest carrier infrastructure just a week ago ). This needs to be fixed ASAP.
57a089635623ed0942ed7d30;Even as a work in progress it's great Still feels like it's not quite done, though i don't have a feature request list or anything. But even at that it's great. Wonderful to have secure messaging that's easy to use and syncs with existing contacts. Thank you very much for the work.
57a089665623ed0942ed7d31;Good thing It works well for me, I've used it for over a year as my default messaging app.
57a089665623ed0942ed7d32;Does what I need it to do plus it is secure.
57a089665623ed0942ed7d33;Thank You!!!
57a089665623ed0942ed7d34;Secure, ok, a few bumps Alright, my family adopted it right away because I'm not allowed to use WhatsApp an my device. Sometimes image preview is not correct or messages arrive multiple times after being offline.
57a089665623ed0942ed7d35;Secure If you want security, this is the app you should be using.
57a089685623ed0942ed7d36;Great built-in everything It might be nice to add specific encryption key selection though.
57a089685623ed0942ed7d37;The clear winner in messaging apps Great interface, easy to use, and very stylish.
57a089685623ed0942ed7d38;Safe and easy Signal is as easy to use as any other messaging app. You can send pictures and other files as well. I transitioned to using Signal and haven't looked back.
57a089685623ed0942ed7d39;Easy to use Works just as well as any other messaging app available with the bonus of added security. Messages are sent without delay and has all the features of your default app. This is my new default app on all my devices.

57a0896b5623ed0942ed7d3f;So far, do good. A modicum of security is always welcome. I don't know if any resource can truly be trusted unless you program it yourself.
57a0896b5623ed0942ed7d40;Nice!
57a0896b5623ed0942ed7d41;Like I liked it

57a089705623ed0942ed7d4a;Protect your privacy! The tool need a little bit of improvement with encryptions keys in groups and some better integration (photo sharing, sound recording). But otherwise there is finally an awesome high level and easy to use encrypted messaging app!
57a089705623ed0942ed7d4b;Great job! Excellent crypto.
57a089705623ed0942ed7d4c;Great Works great

57a089735623ed0942ed7d4e;Fulfills all the criteria With most encryption related apps and software, the main hindrance in uptake by average users is the complicated setup. This takes care of that, and as an additional bonus it is open source. What more can I ask for. It worked flawlessly on Marshmallow and also the Chrome app
57a089735623ed0942ed7d4f;Seems to be a big bug I am being given an error message asking me if I would like to continue using signal as my messaging app. The notification States signal is sending a lot of text messages would I like to change messaging apps. When I press allow the signal app stops working and I am given the selection allow or deny again and again and again and again until I press deny. I'm forced to use a different app.

57a0897e5623ed0942ed7d5c;essential i'm somehow missing video chats. getting new configuration / keys from the scratch sucks - usability fail which smells of GnuPG signing parties ;-) . otherwise - essential.
57a0897e5623ed0942ed7d5d;Problem If an SMS fails to send, no signal for example, does it ever get sent? I can see no way to ask for retry.
57a0897e5623ed0942ed7d5e;Immature but good Basic operation is good. Some aspects need more work e.g. importing contacts.
57a0897e5623ed0942ed7d5f;Exactly what you want for a messaging app Even without the security, it's just what you need for messaging. Lightweight and easy to use.
57a089805623ed0942ed7d60;Good Only one 1. ÿ®ÿ≥€åÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ® Ÿà ÿπÿßŸÑ€å
57a089805623ed0942ed7d61;It rocks. Sneakily.
57a089805623ed0942ed7d62;Secure, easy to setup & use Was able to walk my gf through setup verbally. Great app.
57a089805623ed0942ed7d63;Works great It used to be that it was buggy but now the app has been well matured and no longer buggy. The security is very easy to use and protects you messages with an extra layer of security.
57a089835623ed0942ed7d64;This app is excellent for messaging, but mediocre for VOIP calls. I tested encrypted VOIP calls between two Nexus 5 phones and found the call quality poor. The sound was muffled and there was noticeable noise on the line that made having a conversation difficult. Regular calls between the two phones sounded fine and clear. For messaging, the app is an excellent replacement for other messaging apps, (having tried both the default and other third-party apps) even without the encryption, and the encryption is a nice bonus.
57a089835623ed0942ed7d65;Lock down your texts This app will keep your texts safe without using up your ram and storage. Runs fine on old phone (Alcatel one touch evolve)
57a089835623ed0942ed7d66;Very useful
57a089865623ed0942ed7d67;Works well I appreciate the encryption option
57a089865623ed0942ed7d68;NISHANT Birman Once..
57a089865623ed0942ed7d69;Great Security, Bad Calls I am grateful for this free app and the freedom it provides. Messaging is great, but calls can be rough. Good for anyone who does not want to subconciously alter their interactions with others as a result of knowing that the government collects everything - including private information to discredit those that disagree with it
57a089865623ed0942ed7d6a;Great messenger application! Works great, no complaints!
57a089875623ed0942ed7d6b;Great app Would recommend it.
57a089875623ed0942ed7d6c;Must Have App does exactly what it says, end to end sms encryption. everyone should have this.
57a089875623ed0942ed7d6d;Needs Google Play Services Thats bad, i cant use the Google Play Services.
57a089875623ed0942ed7d6e;It's great I'm still trying to convince friends to switch over.
57a0898a5623ed0942ed7d6f;Great app, almost perfect! Everything is awesome. I love the features. Just wish it didn't have some of the pop ups all the time telling you to recommend the app to friends or rate the app. Still great though, and makes a great replacement for the default messenger app.
57a0898a5623ed0942ed7d70;Doesn't come with as many customizations.
57a0898a5623ed0942ed7d71;Clean app without unnecessary fireworks, using it as main text app
57a0898a5623ed0942ed7d72;As described Private secure encrypted messages
57a0898c5623ed0942ed7d73;Great security and testing app Works as a substitute for regular texting even if recipient doesn't have whisper.
57a0898c5623ed0942ed7d74;Great messenger This app works pretty well as a messenger app if all you need is sms and mms, but the calling feature is a little weird. Other than the calling, its pretty nice
57a0898c5623ed0942ed7d75;The best, great as a total replacement for sms
57a0898f5623ed0942ed7d76;Great app, could use one more feature I haven't had the chance to try out the encrypted messages; I don't know anyone else who has it. But it works great for messaging! It runs fast, it has dark and light themes, and conversation colors. Also, for those with iOS friends, it has an option to use those emoji, so you can see exactly what you're sending. The only feature I wish it had is the ability to customize what happens when you swipe a conversation.
57a0898f5623ed0942ed7d77;Great Very impressed with this app, everyone should use it. Especially if they like their privacy.
57a0898f5623ed0942ed7d78;Pretty close to perfect Great app. Very responsive, secure, and customizable. Pretty much everything you'd want in a messaging app. My only complaint is that the notification light settings don't seem to work for me.
57a089925623ed0942ed7d79;Great texting app, occasionally shows numbers in notification bar instead of contact. Great secure texting app. Only complaint is that the notification bar on both locked and unlocked screen when multiple unread texts it shows the phone number and message preview instead of contact and message preview. Otherwise an awesome app!
57a089925623ed0942ed7d7a;Privacy Rulez
57a089925623ed0942ed7d7b;Works great. If the security is indeed what is promised, all the better.
57a089925623ed0942ed7d7c;Works like a charm Simply the best android messaging app
57a089985623ed0942ed7d7d;Nice app Even if you don't use the encryption aspect, this is a good texting app.
57a089985623ed0942ed7d7e;Very happy 5+ private and trustful application!
57a0899b5623ed0942ed7d7f;Que dorso mi tendo hontira! Mi grimas conta mia
57a0899b5623ed0942ed7d80;Android N DP 5 attachment button doesn't work. Crashes app. Please fix. Awesome. Love the privacy settings. One thing that would set apart this app from others. Auto dark mode at night option, so you're eyes don't get blinded by the white.
57a0899b5623ed0942ed7d81;Does exactly what it says it does. I got my friends to use it by quoting Chris Soghoian: Every time someone downloads Signal and makes their first encrypted call, FBI Director Jim Comey cries.
57a0899d5623ed0942ed7d82;My Rating Easy enough and good features. -1 because when a lot of msg come in you have to scroll up and find the start instead of being directed there via app.
57a0899d5623ed0942ed7d83;Seems OK How would you know if your encrypted messages were hacked anyway?
57a0899d5623ed0942ed7d84;Excelente.
57a0899d5623ed0942ed7d85;Elaborated, simply to use and recommended
57a0899d5623ed0942ed7d86;Great app Best messenger app out there
57a0899f5623ed0942ed7d87;Excellent design, does it's job
57a0899f5623ed0942ed7d88;Fantastic app Everyone should be using it. Just wish it would save group settings.
57a0899f5623ed0942ed7d89;Love it just needs secluded messaging and it would be the best sms app out
57a0899f5623ed0942ed7d8a;please add dual sim support
57a0899f5623ed0942ed7d8b;Wtf Was ok. But is getting worse by the day
57a089a15623ed0942ed7d8c;Why wouldn't you use it? This is why I live Android phones. You can choose to have the industry best practice encryption app as you standard Sms app.
57a089a15623ed0942ed7d8d;Crashes on Android 7 Crashes on Android 7 when trying to add attachments. Really wouldn't expect an issue like this so late in Android 7 beta program.
57a089a15623ed0942ed7d8e;Very good. Solid and works. A few more features in future might be nice but as it stands a solid dependable app. .
57a089a65623ed0942ed7d8f;Great App + Feature Request! I love Signal, love the way it looks and the way it bridges the gap between an SMS and Messaging app. That being said, it would be great if we could turn off "Secure Messaging" for certain contacts / threads. Because, some contacts who earlier joined Signal and then left, are hard to text as each time I wish to send an SMS to them, I have to manually choose send "Insecure SMS". The default mode stays on "Secure Message" even if those people are not on Signal anymore.
57a089a65623ed0942ed7d90;Rock solid, for privacy advocates and dumbbells alike Use anything Open Whisper Systems cooks up. The engineering in their tools is so good they'll make you want to cry. No other app does as much to protect your privacy so openly, or with so much quality, for absolutely free.
57a089a85623ed0942ed7d91;Awesome app
57a089a85623ed0942ed7d92;Perfect The app is awesome and worth paying for...but they only accept donations through their site. They need to change that.
57a089a85623ed0942ed7d93;Awesome Not only does it support encryption but in my opinion it looks better than the stock messaging app
57a089a85623ed0942ed7d94;Very good Improving all the time
57a089a85623ed0942ed7d95;Awesome app!
57a089aa5623ed0942ed7d96;Great secure messaging app Great app, not just for secure messaging. It just does what you want it to, and does it well.
57a089aa5623ed0942ed7d97;Amazing messenger This is my favorite messenger application, open source and secure!
57a089aa5623ed0942ed7d98;Signal app Excellent, no issues, easy to use, encrypted
57a089aa5623ed0942ed7d99;LOVE THIS PRIVATE TIME EXELENTE. MAS PRIVACIDAD CON MI FAMILIA‚ù§ Y AMISTADES ‚ù§... REALLY ENJOY IT.. LOVE THE PRIVACY. BLESSING'S TO ALL üï∞. KEEP IT REAL ‚ù§üé∂‚ù§
57a089ac5623ed0942ed7d9a;It's hard to demonstrate to someone else why they need it I tried asking my friends to use it, but no one seems to care.
57a089ac5623ed0942ed7d9b;Works great on the s7 edge!!! Just started using and so far it's great!!!
57a089ac5623ed0942ed7d9c;Great app Does exactly what it says.
57a089ac5623ed0942ed7d9d;Secure Messaging Thumbs Up Great app! Great UI! Private Messaging. Yes please!
57a089ac5623ed0942ed7d9e;A clean ap I was looking for something with a clean UI but with come color. I found it here.
57a089b15623ed0942ed7d9f;Sweet! Not sure what the "send unencrypted text" prompt means, as I thought this app auto encrypted, but little to no bugs, works very smoothly!
57a089b15623ed0942ed7da0;It's okay Calling can improve a lot
57a089b15623ed0942ed7da1;Good texting with protection Glad I finally enabled a secure SMS client, though I can't personally audit the encryption, and everyone needs to use it for that to work.
57a089b15623ed0942ed7da2;Great app Great app but a banner in every conversation asks me if I want to invite the other person to join the app. Everything is great except that seems a bit too pushy for me.
57a089b85623ed0942ed7da3;Secure and easy to use.
57a089b85623ed0942ed7da4;Good app ... I like Signal ... They say it is secure too.
57a089b85623ed0942ed7da5;GREAT APP The best app on the market for encryption based communications.
57a089b85623ed0942ed7da6;Excellence but Passphrase not working
57a089be5623ed0942ed7da7;Great app, just missing a couple features I need For example, with Google Messenger I can search the body of the messages for certain words, while with Signal I can only search the names. Also, it's not quite as integrated with Google, so harder to use with voice. That being said, it is a great app; love the encryption, the UI, and the fact that I can also SMS: it seems about as close to iMessage as you can currently get on Android. Add the full search and I'll default to Signal and up the rating to 6 stars!
57a089be5623ed0942ed7da8;The good and the bad GOOD: seemed to work well and the interface was nice. It didn't crash on me. Quickly imported. LOVE the encryption. BAD: lots of errors saying message didn't send but people seemed to get them. Encryption only works if they use the app. My under 25 friends seem to use snap chat, 25-35 Facebook messenger, foreign friends use What's App, everyone else the default messenger. So no one wanted to add yet another. Hopefully someday.
57a089c15623ed0942ed7da9;Messed up my contacts. I lost hundreds of names. Now I just have numbers
57a089c15623ed0942ed7daa;Works so well It's so good I've made it my default messaging app (over Textra), everyone should encrypt communications these days, just on principle. Signal developers, keep fighting the good fight!
57a089c15623ed0942ed7dab;It's just awesome Best messaging and best secured app üòòüòòüòòüòò
57a089c15623ed0942ed7dac;Good app. Using it now for a few weeks. Yet to test many features. No problems so far
57a089c15623ed0942ed7dad;Love it Works great
57a089c35623ed0942ed7dae;Signal Must have for everyone.
57a089c35623ed0942ed7daf;0 Verification Error...
57a089c35623ed0942ed7db0;Reliable & Fast. Plus it's open source for security it can't be beat.
57a089c35623ed0942ed7db1;Great app I just wish more people used it. Sharing is caring guys!
57a089c35623ed0942ed7db2;It's the best Not only is this the best messaging app I've used but the encrypted signal message is convenient and easy to use.
57a089c55623ed0942ed7db3;Signal Please Add This Feature Please add auto destruction mode for message. If you will add you will top dog in the rat race of android chat apps. Anyway all upon you. We are your customers we have right to demand anything. Anyway you rocks.
57a089c55623ed0942ed7db4;Love It! Great secured messenger app
57a089c55623ed0942ed7db5;Awesome
57a089c55623ed0942ed7db6;It works Berry sell!
57a089c85623ed0942ed7db7;Almost perfect I love the app but when I add a conversation from my contacts the search is crazy! I will start typing Karin or something and every name is there for the first few letters and even when I type the whole name in there are still contacts on the list with none of those letters. It makes no sense.
57a089c85623ed0942ed7db8;The best of the best Needs no introduction.
57a089c85623ed0942ed7db9;Great Secure messaging, the important bit is what you don't see, so others don't
57a089c85623ed0942ed7dba;Great app! Very user-friendly. My only complaint is that it doesn't allow for selecting messages with a light touch to the screen.
57a089cb5623ed0942ed7dbb;Well designed and simple Very well rounded experience, even without the military grade safety it would still be a very pleasurable app.
57a089cb5623ed0942ed7dbc;The best app
57a089cb5623ed0942ed7dbd;So far so good Only encrypted if sending to another signal user. And many people don't want to download another texting app.
57a089cb5623ed0942ed7dbe;Great !.... Hope you add voice messages ...
57a089cd5623ed0942ed7dbf;Perfect fix for me! I have a galaxy s5 and the default messaging app for some reason wouldn't mark my messages as read so Noni have signal and messages are safe and out of my way!
57a089cd5623ed0942ed7dc0;Wish you had a txt to voice added in
57a089cd5623ed0942ed7dc1;Must have messenger including internet calls Best texting app for everyday use with necessary respect for privacy. Make real private calls. Be yourself.
57a089cf5623ed0942ed7dc2;Great encrypted messaging app Encrypted messaging should be the new standard. Anyone looking for privacy should use this. They did a bunch of updates at first and nailed out some bugs. App is very stable now and functions fast and smoothly. Id recommend to anyone.
57a089cf5623ed0942ed7dc3;Very useful
57a089cf5623ed0942ed7dc4;Bomb!
57a089cf5623ed0942ed7dc5;Only issue is emojis seem to mess up a lot.
57a089d25623ed0942ed7dc6;Absolutely indispensable. If you value your privacy I suggest you install this app and use it every day. We're slowly losing our rights and it's happening being the scenes and no one is noticing. Support your right to privacy. Use signal and get everyone you know on it. This is the most important app ever created.
57a089d25623ed0942ed7dc7;Simple and effective I like it
57a089d25623ed0942ed7dc8;Good app Not only are the texts encrypted (if you text someone with the app) but you also send them like an Im and there is no text limit
57a089d25623ed0942ed7dc9;No calling
57a089d45623ed0942ed7dca;the dark theme makes a huge difference, so I use this now instead of Google messenger. Also nice to have a desktop client.
57a089d45623ed0942ed7dcb;Great App Love the secure chat, all my friends love it too.
57a089d45623ed0942ed7dcc;Great app Has been a great replacement for my default SMS app. Great to see it use the defacto standard in end to end encryption.
57a089d45623ed0942ed7dcd;Autolock option should be in seconds as well
57a089dd5623ed0942ed7dce;Amazing messanger Perfect for me, and it let's me message both signal and non signal addresses from one interface. I just wish the iPhone app did this too
57a089df5623ed0942ed7dcf;It can replace my sms? Sold! I was using another app that required others to use the app in order to send from it. Signal let's you text anyone!
57a089df5623ed0942ed7dd0;Best SMS replacement for Android. Period.
57a089df5623ed0942ed7dd1;Great app Easy to use and the use of encryption is what makes this app what it is
57a089df5623ed0942ed7dd2;Dual Sim Please provide for dual sim
57a089df5623ed0942ed7dd3;ÿπÿßŸÑ€åŸá ÿ®€åÿ≥ÿ™Ÿá
57a089e25623ed0942ed7dd4;Great! Easy to use, and a great way to get more secure.
57a089e25623ed0942ed7dd5;Yes!! Privacy is a right. Essential app on any smartphone. Signal is superbly easy to use & powerfully effective. Use Signal or don't text me.
57a089e25623ed0942ed7dd6;Can't complain No one I know uses this app, but it works well regardless. Can't complain.
57a089e25623ed0942ed7dd7;Esa es! Ahora puedo hacer comunicaciones seguras y/o confidenciales cuando lo necesito ;-)
57a089e45623ed0942ed7dd8;Best sms/messaging app ever Clearly the best sms and messaging app ever for Android! Great encryption if used with other Signal users and at the same time a really good sms app to use with everyone else! Also it have nice looking emojis as on the iPhone, no more ugly looking Android stock emojis.
57a089e45623ed0942ed7dd9;Having trouble sending pictures to Verizon based phones, and replying to group texts. Other than that-- perfect!!!
57a089e45623ed0942ed7dda;Secure SMS and Not Excellent app! I love texting and being secure with my contacts!
57a089e45623ed0942ed7ddb;Great Aplikacion
57a089e75623ed0942ed7ddc;Simple and safe
57a089e75623ed0942ed7ddd;Most over rated app!! 1. How to change the default si m forum normal texting via Signal in dual sim phones.? I've selected sim 2 as my default sim for messaging in system settings. But still Signal is showing sim 1 in the chat box. Looks like a crap!! 2. Forward mesjsages option disappears after selecting multiple messages. 3. Couldn't be able to send normal message when Signal user is offline. I'd like to hear back from you soon!!! Uninstalled since there's no response. Keep it better.
57a089e75623ed0942ed7dde;Good messaging app Doesn't crash, works consistently well.
57a089e95623ed0942ed7ddf;Number one encryption app better than what's up Better than what's up. What's up stores meta data. Signal doesn't store any metadata as per the devs.
57a089e95623ed0942ed7de0;Works great!!!
57a089e95623ed0942ed7de1;ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤
57a089e95623ed0942ed7de2;A random user's review The app works just fine on my Moto X play.
57a089e95623ed0942ed7de3;Excellent App
57a089ed5623ed0942ed7de4;Great Does what it's supposed to do. Great!
57a089ed5623ed0942ed7de5;It is great for secure messaging, but will not default to regular SMS when not having Internet access. Due to this it is not a good choice for a default texting app.
57a089ed5623ed0942ed7de6;Pretty terrific Great ui and options just a few items on the wishlist like ability to create groups, and when msg fails to send more information about why and how to remedy
57a089ed5623ed0942ed7de7;Not fully free software It's a a shame that the telephony servers are not completely free software, and that the app is not officially offered on F-Droid.
57a089f05623ed0942ed7de8;Great and simple interface is great, it's fast, and it's great to have end to end encryption. Two things that prevent me from giving 5 stars. First is the awful image compression, second is how much of a pain it is to switch to a new device.
57a089f05623ed0942ed7de9;Secure... But can't attach after you start email, harder to include multiple addressees. But it's secure.
57a089f05623ed0942ed7dea;Formerly RedPhone and TextSecure. Open source. Voice quality remarkably better than Whatsapp, Viber and Hangouts! - Currently the best way to talk with good privacy. Of course no civilan need such advanced encryption to hide stuff from the partner! But when the government where you live is corrupted...that's another story.
57a089f35623ed0942ed7deb;Not receiving picture messages
57a089f35623ed0942ed7dec;Great, but can you market it so everyone uses it :)
57a089f35623ed0942ed7ded;Best messaging app I've used. This app is so user friendly! I really appreciate the work thats gone into helping folks communicate with privacy. I recommend folks utilize the local encryption setting.
57a089f35623ed0942ed7dee;Recently I've not been able to receive messages.. Or they arrive very late.. Please do look into this.
57a089f35623ed0942ed7def;Pretty good I like it.
57a089f65623ed0942ed7df0;Love the nice clean implementation. Easy to understand and user friendly application. However, checking each others signature could be improved major. It feels like it is hidden far, far away. Good idea to hand the possibility to validate others accounts, but please make it easy to reach and a no-brainer for everyone to use.
57a089f65623ed0942ed7df1;SMS APP REQUIRES PHONE # VERIFICATION??? WHY WOULD AN APP FOR SMS REQUIRE PHONE # VERIFICATION??? STUPID IDIOTS WANT TO RAPE MY PRIVACY!
57a089f65623ed0942ed7df2;Great app No problems, and easily replaces your default messengers app.
57a089f65623ed0942ed7df3;It sucks that none of the muggles can figure out Signal.
57a08a005623ed0942ed7df4;Amazing Well done just wish it had direct integration with Google photos for sharing more quickly within the app.
57a08a005623ed0942ed7df5;Not getting pictures Good app, but I am not getting any media messages. They all fail. Very annoying. Fix this and I will give 5 stars.
57a08a005623ed0942ed7df6;Pretty good Like it, phone calls are kinda sketch, but texts work great. Would love it if it supported sending VCFs. Pain in the ass to send contact files since once this is default app regular text app won't work to send VCFs without making it default. Add VCF send!
57a08a045623ed0942ed7df7;Seamless replacement Signal seamlessly replaces the messaging app. The only thing that has bugged me is the message that appears every time I text a new number saying "invite to use Signal...". While I get the purpose, I'd like to be able to disable this.
57a08a045623ed0942ed7df8;Works really well It works as advertised and being open source it can be publicly audited for security. My only real problem with it is that it will sometimes be slow at receiving message. I have to open the app to get it to pull in the newest messages sometimes, but not to often. But other then that it works very well, now if I could just get more people to use it :)
57a08a045623ed0942ed7df9;2 sim support Now ale Works perfectly!
57a08a075623ed0942ed7dfa;Very good app Sound quality usually very good. Sometimes doesn't connect 1st attempt to talk. Messaging linked to contacts very convenient
57a08a075623ed0942ed7dfb;No learning curve Signal installed cleanly, importing all my IM history and works exactly like the messenger it's replacing. It's like nothing's changed except my privacy.
57a08a075623ed0942ed7dfc;Great app Very good app to use when being private with messages.
57a08a075623ed0942ed7dfd;Excellent software Even without the seamless E2E encryption, it's a simple and fast message client that works well.
57a08a095623ed0942ed7dfe;Works perfectly Works exactly as I expect.
57a08a095623ed0942ed7dff;Solid but not feature rich
57a08a095623ed0942ed7e00;Nice and easy A must have
57a08a095623ed0942ed7e01;Fine app No bugs, easy to use, fine for Android.
57a08a095623ed0942ed7e02;really good 10/10 would download again
57a08a095623ed0942ed7e03;Awesome. Cellebrite can pound sand.
57a08a0b5623ed0942ed7e04;1 problem It's a great messaging app but I notice when I send/receive pictures they always come out grainy and unfocused. Doesn't seem like there's any solution to it.
57a08a0b5623ed0942ed7e05;It works well. Very stable and does what it is supposed to do.
57a08a0b5623ed0942ed7e06;Quick and reliable. Secure messages and photos as well as other sensitive attachments.
57a08a0b5623ed0942ed7e07;Love it!! Never have failed messages or notifications and the options are easy to figure out. Love the colors with the black background. Makes it easier to read.
57a08a0d5623ed0942ed7e08;Great app, though it would be nice if they added a widget
57a08a0d5623ed0942ed7e09;It's good Can't complain,
57a08a0d5623ed0942ed7e0a;Great app. Fantastic app for anyone concerned with privacy. Works great, is secure. What more can one ask?
57a08a0d5623ed0942ed7e0b;Great app I like the app. Great voice calls. I would certainly recommend it. Download.
57a08a0d5623ed0942ed7e0c;Great software!!! Nothing to complain with this version!
57a08a125623ed0942ed7e0d;Emojis Update your emojis please.
57a08a125623ed0942ed7e0e;Great app Secure and so far it's great
57a08a125623ed0942ed7e0f;The best replace for the default SMS app I convinced some of my friends to use Signal and it is great, but it is even better as replace for the default SMS app since the majority of my friends are not using it yet. There is still some bugs, and the speed is not as fast as WhatsApp (specially when calling).
57a08a125623ed0942ed7e10;Great security but lacking features I wish this had decent desktop clients and a few more features to compete with Telegram and similar chat apps.
57a08a155623ed0942ed7e11;Something is wrong Started to chew my battery life on my zenfone 2. Better than most factory loaded messenger apps with the added bonus of having encryption.
57a08a155623ed0942ed7e12;verey good hoopfly its real Security and Encrypted verey good to call and text
57a08a155623ed0942ed7e13;Good App Works well, can't complain, but I would encourage you to use it as if the NSA was watching since they probably are.
57a08a155623ed0942ed7e14;This is a solid app!
57a08a155623ed0942ed7e15;Love it Nice to use and secure üòä
57a08a175623ed0942ed7e16;Better than I expected. I was always happy with the standard messaging. But after I tried this app and tweaked a couple of settings it worked better with my pebble watch than my old messaging.
57a08a175623ed0942ed7e17;Been using it for one hour, already like it! Simple and clean. Responsive and not full of adds.
57a08a175623ed0942ed7e18;Works great!
57a08a175623ed0942ed7e19;Smart move!!! Excellent. The best!!!
57a08a175623ed0942ed7e1a;An excellent app.
57a08a235623ed0942ed7e1b;Not yet on F-Droid Releasing this app on F-Droid would be very welcome.
57a08a235623ed0942ed7e1c;No complaints with this app except all incoming texts are received via signal. Annoying.
57a08a235623ed0942ed7e1d;Great app Love this app and the ability in import/export messages you want to save. Phone calls are a bit buggy at times.
57a08a235623ed0942ed7e1e;Easy to use Great benefits. I'm going to start asking my friends to install it for their own safety
57a08a255623ed0942ed7e1f;BUG When sharing a picture from gallery to signal. It crashes permanently.
57a08a255623ed0942ed7e20;Lil slow with delays in message delivery Also sometimes there is no notification inspite of notifications mode being on for the app
57a08a255623ed0942ed7e21;Works well including dual SIM
57a08a255623ed0942ed7e22;Love it Great app l love it big tym
57a08a255623ed0942ed7e23;Thks you Very good,,appreciate it. Pls do not update,,,,now is perfect.
57a08a285623ed0942ed7e24;Messaging made easy A very secure and safe way to do your communications. Keep it up.
57a08a285623ed0942ed7e25;Awsome The best app of type
57a08a285623ed0942ed7e26;Yep, ita good Great so far. Very easy to use and very pleased.
57a08a285623ed0942ed7e27;Best sms app out there Works great, super secure, online extension is the best
57a08a285623ed0942ed7e28;Best messanging app Simply best
57a08a2c5623ed0942ed7e29;SECURITY! Amazing app. Switched from AwSMS. It could use more customization though.
57a08a2c5623ed0942ed7e2a;Security: check; other features: almost there Really love the way it helps me manage those conversations that must be kept secure. There a re a couple of items that I wish were a bit more friendly/easy to use. Also, there is a kind of a bug that when I set the apps to be in a card form to terminate a some and I choose Signal, it sends all other programs away :/ would it be possible le to look into it?? Well done guys.
57a08a2c5623ed0942ed7e2b;Best Secure Text App Love it. Easy to use, easy to convince others to use, cute emoji. Win-win-win.
57a08a305623ed0942ed7e2c;Fantastic!
57a08a305623ed0942ed7e2d;A timely solution Signal Private Messenger is a great app that works very well, and under today's sky-is-falling, emperor's-new-clothes environment, it is a timely solution to the erasure of our privacy. I have no further comment at this time.
57a08a305623ed0942ed7e2e;Great
57a08a305623ed0942ed7e2f;Much more polished than other apps, no issues, happy user!
57a08a335623ed0942ed7e30;Wish I could add a profile pic but it's a good messaging app besides that. I like telegrams emojis.
57a08a335623ed0942ed7e31;Would love the integration of Android N quick reply feature (right from the notification panel)
57a08a335623ed0942ed7e32;Chat background change I love this app. Plz add chat background change
57a08a335623ed0942ed7e33;New user In general I like the app but I cannot use it if I do not get confirmation that my message has been read and the "last seen" option is not available.
57a08a365623ed0942ed7e34;Great app, would recommend I've been using this for a while now, and it's been flawless. Stable and responsive, nice UI, no complaints from me.
57a08a365623ed0942ed7e35;Good concept, bad service Keep having to resend messages, also media never seems to download. Might have to switch back to default messenger just to be able to talk to people
57a08a365623ed0942ed7e36;Gr8 M8 Tired of big brother tapping your phone? Tired of your wife catching you sending dick pictures to other women? Do you wear your tin-foil hat on a daily basis? If you answered yes to any of these questions then download this app immediately.
57a08a3a5623ed0942ed7e37;Its fine I cant send group messages however because i dont have MMS on my phone and so are my other friends, so if only you add the capability to still send group messages by means of SMS, that would be great.
57a08a3a5623ed0942ed7e38;Very good and usefull Simple, easy to use, and very secure apps
57a08a3a5623ed0942ed7e39;Very very good at what it does. Wanted a simple texting app with the features i was looking for... has them all and the security is a bonus.
57a08a3a5623ed0942ed7e3a;Privacy Because I deserve it. I'm a human being.
57a08a3d5623ed0942ed7e3b;Problem When attempt secure call android phone dials normal insecure call out of the app
57a08a3d5623ed0942ed7e3c;It's a better hangouts Better in every way for obvious security and privacy reasons. It could be better if it didn't use Google's messaging service though. There is a FOSS fork of Signal called freeSignal I believe for those interested.
57a08a3d5623ed0942ed7e3d;shame it can't block dodgy texas
57a08a415623ed0942ed7e3e;Brilliant, but with one major flaw There is only thing keeping Signal from being perfect - there is no automatic fallback to SMS. If your friend uses Signal, but his mobile data is currently off, he won't get your message - Signal should be able to detect it and automatically fall back to using SMS to make sure the message gets delivered. It is possible (eg. iMessage and many others on Android as well). Please make it happen! Thanks Open Whisper Systems!
57a08a415623ed0942ed7e3f;Fantastic! I have completely replaced my stock messaging app with Signal. Security in a convenient package. Top notch app.
57a08a415623ed0942ed7e40;Pretty great thus far!!
57a08a445623ed0942ed7e41;Excellent Love end to end encryption & this app is very easy to use. If it's good enough for Ed Snowden, it's good enough for me
57a08a445623ed0942ed7e42;Great, but It has trouble copy and pasting text outside the app
57a08a445623ed0942ed7e43;Not getting messages Lately I have not been getting messages. I only find out when I speak to someone on the phone or via email etc. and they ask why I did not reply or mention messages they sent me, but I never got them. Just now got a message that was apparently sent several days ago. Makes me wonder how many of my "sent" messages (many of which lately have gotten no responses) never make it through. Never able to send video/audio messages, no idea why.
57a08a515623ed0942ed7e44;Great. Love it. Replaced my stock messaging app.
57a08a515623ed0942ed7e45;It's great. So far going good, Loving it.
57a08a515623ed0942ed7e46;FANTASTIC Fast, easy to use, dependable. I fully recommend.
57a08a545623ed0942ed7e47;Love it! Awesome this is the only app in the store that kets me send videos and picture because I havn't rooted my phone yet
57a08a545623ed0942ed7e48;Nice! Pretty awesome. Better than hangouts. It's fast and simple. This is my go to messenger as of now. Don't need what's app either. Using this as my daily driver. Keep up the good work. Has all the functionality of what's app and hangouts. Can do Wi-Fi calls and messages!! And send regualr MMS and SMS. Need to improve on call quality. Would be nice if I can send longer video's and bigger files
57a08a545623ed0942ed7e49;Fast and secure! I really like this app and highly recommend as an SMS alternative.
57a08a575623ed0942ed7e4a;Excellent privacy. No ads. Open source. Works.
57a08a575623ed0942ed7e4b;Love it
57a08a575623ed0942ed7e4c;Works great as an SMS replacement. Added bonus of end to end encryption if people are onboard. How much better it handles group SMS is worth it on its own.
57a08a575623ed0942ed7e4d;Gold
57a08a575623ed0942ed7e4e;Awesome It's so easy to use and it exactly satisfies it's purpose.

57a08a5b5623ed0942ed7e51;Great messaging app Easy to use and I love the fact that it protects my privacy. Like all good messenger app that protect our privacy (bbm) the tough part it's to convince our friends to use it when they are used to whatzapp or Facebook.
57a08a5b5623ed0942ed7e52;Pretty good The search function flaked out for a bit there and accessing archived messages seems to be impractical but it is generally pretty good
57a08a5e5623ed0942ed7e53;Best This is the most secure texting app I've ever found. Smart, reliable, and easy to operate.
57a08a5e5623ed0942ed7e54;Will not export When I export my messages the file is empty.
57a08a5e5623ed0942ed7e55;Brill
57a08a5e5623ed0942ed7e56;Very well done I feel so much more secure using this app, and it's fast, great looking, and well designed, and the quick reply is the best of any app. I actually like that it doesn't use Android emoji too. Going to keep using increasingly until all my friends do too.
57a08a615623ed0942ed7e57;Better than the default pre-installed. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 from T-Mobile and this is much better than the default app.
57a08a615623ed0942ed7e58;Excellent
57a08a615623ed0942ed7e59;Great Thumbs high
57a08a615623ed0942ed7e5a;Ok I'm unable to receive MMS messages with this app.
57a08a615623ed0942ed7e5b;Safe and secure Very good for communication
57a08a6a5623ed0942ed7e5c;The Best The most intelligent flashcard system, it makes learning a breeze.
57a08a6a5623ed0942ed7e5d;They just need to add a cloud option where your cards are saved and synced across all your devices. Cute/good little app for what it is made to do.
57a08a6a5623ed0942ed7e5e;Buggy. I import a collection of words related to politics, and when I browse the cards, it displays a different collection altogether?
57a08a6a5623ed0942ed7e5f;Fantastic! I've been using this app to learn English and it is very easy and amazing! Thank you so much for it.
57a08a6b5623ed0942ed7e60;Stupid I cannot view other peoples cards online uninstalling
57a08a6b5623ed0942ed7e61;The Best Free App Just download and don't hesitate. Updates kept it cooler and better. Others just doesnt know how to use it.
57a08a6b5623ed0942ed7e62;Best card learning app
57a08a6b5623ed0942ed7e63;Yeah! Def one of the best apps for learning. Basic , simple, efficient.
57a08a6b5623ed0942ed7e64;Awesome Thank u man, this is the best app ever, (tnx for fixing play botton)
57a08a6e5623ed0942ed7e65;Disappointed For some reason certain words get mixed with other flashcards. My flashcard for 'ataque' is always with the word 'el tel√©fono celular' and several others have the same problem. I've tried separating the decks but it's no use. Deeply disappointed in this app.
57a08a6e5623ed0942ed7e66;Best SRS (Spaced Repetition Software) app. Bad reviews probably didn't get that the app doesn't include any ready-made flashcard deck, so the shared decks are made by users (that's why some may contain errors). There are great shared decks though (at least for japanese I've found great ones), and in any case the best way to use this app would be to make your own flashcards.
57a08a6e5623ed0942ed7e67;Nice open source app More flashcard content need to be created by users..
57a08a705623ed0942ed7e68;It's Super Effective! I would not have passed my Spanish final without this app. Period. This app motivates you to start studying earlier (at least for me) and you will pretty much never forget anything you learn with this (for a very long time). The meme thing makes it super easy to remember everything.
57a08a705623ed0942ed7e69;All in bold in this update This is the best Flashcards app. But that last update is showing all cads font in bold.
57a08a705623ed0942ed7e6a;The function red marked line of duplicated card is not work correctly ( in particular for old added cards, maybe after cards import ) 2. Sometimes cards are not refreshed in the card browser (after adding card)
57a08a725623ed0942ed7e6b;Have I missed something ? I read a lot of good things about this app so I wanted to use it to practice my chinese with flash cards. There is very little content and the only stuff I got has some errors in it / poor quality. I assume I'll have to continue my search for a great chinese flashcards app.
57a08a725623ed0942ed7e6c;Useful Helps me to memorize things when I have a few spare minutes.
57a08a725623ed0942ed7e6d;Completely unclear interface Completely unclear and non-intuitive interface. Looking for analog
57a08a755623ed0942ed7e6e;Needs a tutorial or something. Can't figure out how to tell it I got an answer right or wrong, and the red, green, and blue buttons at the bottom don't seem to do anything
57a08a755623ed0942ed7e6f;If there was a paid version of this app, I'd pay for it
57a08a755623ed0942ed7e70;This is excellent. This app is very good and very useful. Install this, and enjoy.
57a08a755623ed0942ed7e71;Awesome app There are a lot of flash card decks available on AnkiWeb for a lot of major topics, though there are still a few good topics missing
57a08a775623ed0942ed7e72;Love it Amazing app, keep it free.
57a08a775623ed0942ed7e73;Wonderful App Something of a must-have app. Takes a bit of getting used but there's plenty of guidance online should you need it. Great way to learn something new or cement knowledge.
57a08a775623ed0942ed7e74;Thank you
57a08a775623ed0942ed7e75;Useful It's one of my favorite Apps; if you want memories something just use it, it is can help you and you can make your own advance flashcard
57a08a7a5623ed0942ed7e76;Muito bom Faz uma grande diferen√ßa no aprendizado, sempre nos lembrando o que j√° estudamos.
57a08a7a5623ed0942ed7e77;Terrific app! Thanks to all who work on it. Two small requests: 1. The language I'm learning uses three fairly obscure characters: ∆• ∆≠ ∆à. These show up fine on the desktop version, but render as blank spaces or a ? on the app. These misrenders then get synced back onto the database. Is there a chance this could get fixed, or should I go ahead and find alternate characters to represent them? 2. One of the advantages of a mobile app flashcard system is that you can easily create audio flashcards in the field. The current app requires five touches to record audio (+, Add, paperclip, record audio, RECORD). It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps, though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface.
57a08a7b5623ed0942ed7e78;Cloze deletion How to add cloze deletions
57a08a7b5623ed0942ed7e79;Excellent The best to study medicine, highly recommended
57a08a7b5623ed0942ed7e7a;You wanna learn something This is the way to do it. Deceptively clever.
57a08a7b5623ed0942ed7e7b;Amazing app! use it daily for everything
57a08a7d5623ed0942ed7e7c;Awesome Free, no ads, helps a lot
57a08a7d5623ed0942ed7e7d;Great update. I especially like the improvements to Instant Add API ;)
57a08a7d5623ed0942ed7e7e;Very usefull app This app very usefull and loved appüòâ

57a08a7d5623ed0942ed7e80;Progressive Studying Direct port from the desktop version - Arguably the single best study tool for any subject that requires a lot of memorization
57a08a8d5623ed0942ed7e81;The best one! Definitely the best finance application on market! I was try several, buy it few from market, but this one is the best. It is very useful for managing accounts in different currencies and looking total in only one, preferred currency. Looking nice too, integrated calculator, synchronization and much more than I need. Thanks for ad-free this excellent application!
57a08a8d5623ed0942ed7e82;Still learning but wonderful design First love at first sight
57a08a8d5623ed0942ed7e83;Add auto backup to google drive and it's perfect
57a08a905623ed0942ed7e84;Pls include account transfer feature. If I am doing account transfer, it is showing in expenditure and that money is being accounted twice, once in transfer and once in actual expenditure.
57a08a905623ed0942ed7e85;Search option not available...it would be nice to add a search option which brings up a report of the searched item with the transacted amounts.
57a08a905623ed0942ed7e86;Good design, poor functionalities Not even recurring transactions. I guess it's also not updated anymore.
57a08a905623ed0942ed7e87;As a student, I have my own educational expense. But I need to add them in "child education" which is "Family" category. Check this and make a category named "Education"
57a08a925623ed0942ed7e88;Needs more functions. I input so much data but don't get much for my commitment to the app. Things like graphs and report options including how much I spend on food each week all grouped into one easy read section.
57a08a925623ed0942ed7e89;I hated Data are lost in the apps when it is login
57a08a925623ed0942ed7e8a;Seems to be dead Development seems to have stopped. A shame since it had the potential to be the best expense manager out there.
57a08a925623ed0942ed7e8b;Great app It's work wonderful using it for an year it's awesome, suggestion to upgrade it's UI, new design icons and warning option if budget exceed it's level like that...
57a08a945623ed0942ed7e8c;Almost there... Add report of income Add reports of income and a combined graph of income as well as expenses. Graphs of accounts is also preferable
57a08a945623ed0942ed7e8d;Awesome Update: Latest material design is awesome . Dev, you rock. Tried other apps and finally came back. Dev rocks. Update: Needs update. The last change was in 2015
57a08a945623ed0942ed7e8e;Hate that it automatically clears account and category and some changes (like adding a note). Also if I have 1 account it should always be automatically selected.
57a08a985623ed0942ed7e8f;please add budget
57a08a985623ed0942ed7e90;Amazing design and does what it says however there i a missing feature I would appreciate it if you can add this feature, taking a picture and have it as a note for any record, that way i can take a picture of a receipt and have it there for when i need it. If this is done then I'll rate 5 !
57a08a985623ed0942ed7e91;Great app Simplicity what u get
57a08a985623ed0942ed7e92;Good apps, I use it over a year! Better show monthly total expense trend to trace the usage of money
57a08a9c5623ed0942ed7e93;The Most Efficient Finance Management App Have one big issue recently, all my data is gone. I have post the issue on github. I will rate it back if the problem is fixed... Separated Accounts, Simple Chart Report, Tagging and many other useful functions built inside a very friendly, nice and easy-to-use interface makes Financius so extraordinary and outstanding for those who always get confused why is their wallets so thin at the end of the month.
57a08a9c5623ed0942ed7e94;Security Pressing security feature in settings crashes the app. I have to give it 1 star.
57a08a9c5623ed0942ed7e95;Great app
57a08a9c5623ed0942ed7e96;Terrible Will not save a single thing I put in
57a08a9e5623ed0942ed7e97;Improve please I think there was an older version were it made sense in owerview to si the income and expence in the sanme tab . I dont see the logic of removing this options. Still werry happy with the app :) so in the last days back up and profile login bug crashes app all the time . Please fix.
57a08a9e5623ed0942ed7e98;Since the last update I cannot save my incomes or outcomes.. It just says as pending
57a08a9e5623ed0942ed7e99;Menu The menu can show the options instead of "show all"!
57a08a9e5623ed0942ed7e9a;Needs budgeting Without budgeting this app is useless.
57a08a9f5623ed0942ed7e9b;Good app and no ads in free version It was my favourite app ever.
57a08a9f5623ed0942ed7e9c;Very hard to know it's functionality
57a08a9f5623ed0942ed7e9d;Nice and Simple It's great simple tool to keep track your expenses. Look nice and without adds :)!!!
57a08aa15623ed0942ed7e9e;Almost complete app The app looks good, works good. Just the following features must be added : 1. Recurring expense 2. Money Lending option.please add these features. And the people who are complaining about account transfer is not available, please do check the app throughly then comment. When adding transaction there is a button on left hand corner for that. Red for expense, green for income & grey for transfer. Hope this will help.
57a08aa15623ed0942ed7e9f;Great but I can't import or clear and restore from a backup when I'm logged in an email.
57a08aa15623ed0942ed7ea0;Best app to track Expense
57a08aa45623ed0942ed7ea1;Best finance app Few suggestions: add search option, account transfer option, sharing with family members, monthly income report, transaction list for each category. Also, tags are not really useful as you can't filter report by them. This would make it perfect!
57a08aa45623ed0942ed7ea2;Please add share option
57a08aa45623ed0942ed7ea3;Add notification This application is a great app and has helped me to keep track of my expenses but it will be more useful, if it has notification that can be configured to remind uses to enter expenses at a referred time
57a08aa45623ed0942ed7ea4;Free and easy to use Great app!
57a08aa75623ed0942ed7ea5;Great app Loving it! Great GUI. I'm just missing a widget for easily adding a transaction.
57a08aa75623ed0942ed7ea6;Please provide a manual sync button. Last time when I reset my phone & relogin, I lost 2 weeks' data. It is not always syncing automatically to Google Drive.
57a08aa75623ed0942ed7ea7;Could be better This app strikes a good balance of simplicity and being informative. There are a few things that I think should help improve this app: Income reports / Overview Screen widgets / Ability to set default screen.
57a08aa75623ed0942ed7ea8;Best Expense Tracking App The best among the rest
57a08aa95623ed0942ed7ea9;Does everything I need Except loans. The issue isn't big enough to take away a star, but it would really work better for me if an option for loans was available (both ways).
57a08aa95623ed0942ed7eaa;Amazing app with capability for multiple accounts, each in a currency of your choice. Truly useful, can make a cash account and bank account and transfer to keep track of ATM withdrawals. Only problem: settings button doesn't work, to over ride, slide from left. Wish there were more statistics but great app.
57a08aa95623ed0942ed7eab;Financius has stopped! Please fix it asappp
57a08aa95623ed0942ed7eac;Great effort
57a08aab5623ed0942ed7ead;Happy with it for years Though not much update
57a08aab5623ed0942ed7eae;Just what I was searching for Great app...nice interface
57a08aab5623ed0942ed7eaf;Almost 5 stars It needs borrowing/lending option. And also, you can't see how much you've spent on one category across months (ot any time period you chose)
57a08aab5623ed0942ed7eb0;Import CSV Is there any way tu convert my CSV to JSON so I can use it a s a restore to the application ? I see that there is a lot of ID's in the JSON File Thanks,
57a08aad5623ed0942ed7eb1;Easy to use and beautiful And Thank you very much for ad-free!
57a08aad5623ed0942ed7eb2;Best Budget Tracking App Ever! This is the best budget tracking app I have ever used! User interface is simple and intuitive, multiple accounts can be set within the app to cover different fields of expenditure, multi-currencies for international users. CVS file can be exported to phone or Google drive for further financial analysis. No ads or surcharge. Great app.
57a08aad5623ed0942ed7eb3;Simply fantastic, and it is ad free!
57a08aad5623ed0942ed7eb4;The Best!!! I've tried all the other apps, this is just the best one. Hands down!
57a08aae5623ed0942ed7eb5;Very Nice APP. Would be amazing if you could add Charts, Tables and pie Reports, with PDF export. Wouldn't mind having it on a paid version.
57a08aae5623ed0942ed7eb6;Simple app Could be better. Not maintenaned.
57a08aae5623ed0942ed7eb7;Its am awesome application. Very neatly designed, precise about the functionally. A must have app. I have a suggestion of we could have a filtering option in the transactions page. Like filter by account, or filter by incoming or expense or transfers. It would be great.
57a08ab05623ed0942ed7eb8;My perfect personal economy companion This is the best app for my needs, it has everything I need and more! Beautifuly designed and thinked for simplicity. Excelent work!!
57a08ab05623ed0942ed7eb9;4 star could be 5 Awsome app but i would like to see reports on income aswell as expenditure
57a08ab05623ed0942ed7eba;As it should I hope account transfers will be added .
57a08ab05623ed0942ed7ebb;Clean and simple Please add filter option for category.
57a08ab15623ed0942ed7ebc;Good but a couple of issues Great app but there is a couple of issues and bugs.
57a08ab15623ed0942ed7ebd;Best app of its kind Thanks dev team!
57a08ab15623ed0942ed7ebe;please add view detail transaction for each account usage
57a08ab15623ed0942ed7ebf;Nice application Really good app. I think it only needs professional ui/ux design and detailed reports.
57a08ab55623ed0942ed7ec0;Wish there was a computer app as well I wish I could just jump online on my pc and plug in a bunch of stuff to get started. I am trying to look at trends in the last few months of my accounts, but have to input each separately, which can be a little clunky on the phone, but I have always preferred a really keyboard. Otherwise fantastic
57a08ab55623ed0942ed7ec1;Best App with cool design Add budget feature to take control of expenses . Expect some updates... new features... * may be add filter in Transactions for categories or Accounts * click on categories to open transactions in the category
57a08ab55623ed0942ed7ec2;Almost! Needs income shown on reports.
57a08ab95623ed0942ed7ec3;Love it!! But i think it is about time that you change your UI a little bit. The only problems i hv is double log in, and while entering a transaction, i hv to go up and down because it clearedabove option when entering note
57a08ab95623ed0942ed7ec4;Originally gave ****, but after using for 2 weeks, I'm changing to ***. Improving the following would make me change back to ****. -- App is unable to filter transactions. ---- This means I am unable to show transactions from only 1 account. -- There is no option to transfer a balance. ---- This would come in handy when paying off a credit card. I currently have to do this as two separate transactions. -- App is unable to set up repeating payments. ---- This would be useful for recurring monthly bills.This also means I can't use the app as a bill reminder. >>Adding the following idea as well would make it a ***** app for me. -- An option for shared accounts to be updated from multiple devices. ---- This can possibly be done through text messaging from the app. The shared account will have a phone number on file. When the account is updated the app will send a text to that phone number. When the text message is received, the app can be running in the background, and update itself based on info in the text message. If the app is not running in the background, then it should update the information when the app is opened.
57a08abc5623ed0942ed7ec5;it's great! really!! I think that is missing just a little thing: the incomes in the Category Report!!! That's so important! I need to know automatically and precisely how much i gained that month.
57a08abc5623ed0942ed7ec6;Fantastic App. I LOVE the clean design. Before I make it my go-to money app, I'll need to see more features added (automatic recurring payment, sub-categories, et al). Keep up the good work.
57a08abc5623ed0942ed7ec7;Perfect! Took me awhile to find the transfer button though, when you add a new transaction, click the circle on the top left until it is gray, thats how you transfer money between accounts!
57a08abe5623ed0942ed7ec8;Great for finances Great app only problem is, I'm not sure how to add money to an account. When I select the salary option it still withdrawals money from the account instead of adding money to the account. Unsure if this is a bug or I'm missing something. Once this is fixed it will be 5 stars.
57a08abe5623ed0942ed7ec9;Very Unintuitive Can't for the life me work out to make debit transactions to balances. Every time I add a transaction it adds it to the balance of the account.
57a08abe5623ed0942ed7eca;Beautiful app, works great! Would love to see a widget for this, maybe even Android wear support. Absolutely fantastic app though!
57a08abe5623ed0942ed7ecb;Amazing, Simple, no ads!
57a08abf5623ed0942ed7ecc;Not all currency's shown Does have the Canadian dollar as a currency option. More stars for more currency options. Nice app other wise.
57a08abf5623ed0942ed7ecd;Perfect For years I have been looking for a simple app that just does basic budget management so I can move away from spreadsheets. Rarely I discover an app that changes my daily life. Thanks Imgur!
57a08abf5623ed0942ed7ece;Exactly what I needed! Just the app I'm looking for. I really like the simplicity of it.
57a08abf5623ed0942ed7ecf;Import Data Is there a way to import data?
57a08ac15623ed0942ed7ed0;I ‚ô• this app! Please some income report! Please give new feature, Please give search box!! Please new report on the income not just expense.. Thank's. Anyway, it's wonderfull app!! ‚ô• this backup!
57a08ac45623ed0942ed7ed1;It's a great app. Very clean layout. Could you please add bills reminder?
57a08ac45623ed0942ed7ed2;Automatic updated currency failed I can make an updated for currency for IDR. I used 2 currency in my account, so I need an updated IDR to $ currency exchange.
57a08ac45623ed0942ed7ed3;Account Transfers I'd have given 5 stars if there was an option to enter transfers between 2 accounts.
57a08ac65623ed0942ed7ed4;Please allow to review the transactions of a certain account and category Great great app .. It allows income and outcome , several accounts and backup, it has easy access .. beautiful design .. it only could be better if it allowes to view the transaction for a certain account or a certain category rather than reviewing them all at once .. then it would be PERFECT and I'll advice all my friends and loved ones with it and it'll deserve 5 stars FOR SURE
57a08ac65623ed0942ed7ed5;Great design Unfortunately, I can't sponsor you because the place I live not support online paid.
57a08ac65623ed0942ed7ed6;Awesome App. Loved its simplicity. Dec 2015 update....Crashing again and again while changing tags and categories. Useless now
57a08ac95623ed0942ed7ed7;good overall it would be great if you can add auto scheduling backup to user's gdrive.
57a08ac95623ed0942ed7ed8;Graph is hard to read The old linear one was much easier to understand, this one creates curves spontaneously where they do not exist
57a08ac95623ed0942ed7ed9;Its great I like the app its nice smooth design is minimalistic has everything you need to track your expenses. But i am rating 4 cause the problem is you cant see your income at reports. Hope you guys add that feature
57a08ac95623ed0942ed7eda;I love this app. Easy and nice interface. Although it is free it has alot of features like paid apps.
57a08aca5623ed0942ed7edb;Application is crashing again and again whenever I'm changing any category. Please suggest Whenever I'm trying to switch category or going to select mode of payment app is getting hanged and getting crashed. I'm not sure what all information you are looking for. Please be more specific if you really care or delete this app.
57a08aca5623ed0942ed7edc;Perfect Helps me manage my expenses in every possible aspect. Too many great and useful features. Good job!
57a08aca5623ed0942ed7edd;No, just a star for you
57a08ada5623ed0942ed7ede;Reports needs a big improvement The report section needs a complete overhall it does not shows details of income and transfer, if someone want to check how much income he has made from a specific categary there is no option same goes for transfers, graphs and manhatons should also be included as they give a much clear picture, rest of the application in superb easy to use and great interface and customisable, please improve the reporting section in the next update else u will lose a lot of users because of it
57a08ae05623ed0942ed7edf;I used Financius for about a year and a half, replacing Spendee. Financius was the best expense manager that I had seen during the time I was using it. Once I encountered another app called Expense Manager, it became a tossup on which one was better. Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit. So I prefer Financius for the reporting and UI, but Expense Manager for the functionality. If Financius were to add widgets, it would reign supreme for me again.
57a08ae05623ed0942ed7ee0;How to recover PIN? I have forgotten my 4-digit PIN. Is there anyway to recover it? I tried to uninstall and reinstall. But as soon as I try to login using my gmail ID, it starts asking for PIN again.
57a08ae35623ed0942ed7ee1;It was a good app Now it is crashing too often to the point it is barely usable :/
57a08ae35623ed0942ed7ee2;The right one for me I tried so many apps to record my incomes and expanses, and no others are like this one. It's local, supports sync, multi counts, custom categories and simple report, and ads free. 5 stars for your work. Thank you.
57a08ae35623ed0942ed7ee3;Very handy tool to track expense s I have been using this App from over a year now, and I have to say its very useful to keep track where's our money going. Thanks to Designers and Developer team for producing such a useful product.
57a08ae35623ed0942ed7ee4;Great Great, but add "report by tags"
57a08ae55623ed0942ed7ee5;No support and hasn't been worked on for ages. No support and hasn't been worked on for ages.
57a08ae55623ed0942ed7ee6;Best personal finance manager in the town!
57a08ae55623ed0942ed7ee7;Super app Thanks for the great job!!!. I bought a popcorn for developer :D
57a08ae55623ed0942ed7ee8;Simple and intuitive. I tried many finance/budget apps before switching it to this. This app is way more simple and powerful. I recommend a budgeting option in future updates.
57a08ae55623ed0942ed7ee9;Great App, for tracking expense
57a08ae75623ed0942ed7eea;Bad new design The new design, especially the new transaction view, is horrible compares to last version - not only is it uglier it's lacking features and is harder to navigate and use. Dev should focus on features than just making it look pretty
57a08ae75623ed0942ed7eeb;good, but.. 1) wrong currency for Belarussian ruble 2) doesn't have black theme
57a08ae75623ed0942ed7eec;Lost backup New look kinda boring.... lost all backup.
57a08ae75623ed0942ed7eed;Simple and easy to use It would be great if we can get dictionary help for tag field while typing
57a08aeb5623ed0942ed7eee;Best financial app for me! Tried the rest, only this helps me in managing my accounts! I like that it handles multiple currencies üòä
57a08aeb5623ed0942ed7eef;Nice tracking app It took me a while to configure it to my taste, but I finally figured out how to transfer fund from one account to another. You have to click the transfer icon next to the balance number in the transaction screen until it turns gray, which means it isn't an income nor expense. The trend graph is amazing.
57a08aeb5623ed0942ed7ef0;Really Great App Able to track source of income, transactions flow from one account to another. Ease of use and above all it is ads free. Now, it automatically synced to your Google account. No more worry of losing data when your phone is lost or reformatted. I love it
57a08aed5623ed0942ed7ef1;Life saving app go for it
57a08aed5623ed0942ed7ef2;This is elegant and easy to use. I am a fan. There are few bugs but not restrictive.
57a08aed5623ed0942ed7ef3;Awesome...awesome...!! This is what I wanted..!! Please add a feature to view the annual report also.
57a08aed5623ed0942ed7ef4;adding functionality Add widget, please!
57a08aed5623ed0942ed7ef5;Need additional feature Please add account transfer option
57a08af25623ed0942ed7ef6;New Update completely messed my data I restored my backup like always and updated all transactions, and later logged in to find out all my new transactions were discarded and an old backup was synced from server.
57a08af25623ed0942ed7ef7;You could've created a widget feature, it will be very helpful
57a08af25623ed0942ed7ef8;Sleek. Would love to see updates. Very light app. Has all the simplicity and functions for average use and expense logging. But still feels incomplete without few features like transfer between accounts, sub categories and recurrent auto transaction logging.
57a08af45623ed0942ed7ef9;Currency rates cannot be refreshed I cannot update the rates between different currencies and hope this can be fixed
57a08af45623ed0942ed7efa;good
57a08af45623ed0942ed7efb;Nice Good one
57a08af45623ed0942ed7efc;Sticky
57a08af45623ed0942ed7efd;Patiently waiting: Auto backup; Billing recurrent; Budget; Notification for Bills; Credit card
57a08af75623ed0942ed7efe;Good but... I really miss a feature to see both the salary and expenses in the Reports. With just expenses shown I can't tell if I'm in a positive balance or not at the end of the month. Also, what are the graphs for if they don't show the numbers on Y axis? I can't click on them to get the data tip as shown in screenshots here. Option to expend the category and show Tag expenses when you click on Pie chart. Cheers!
57a08af75623ed0942ed7eff;The best The best finance app i have used so far. After a bit of learning curve mainly to understand hoe this works i feel very comfortable using this app now. We can maintain multiple accounts and track expenses for each account easily. I like the fact that we cam enter the time for each transaction; handy when you want to track sequential transactions.
57a08afa5623ed0942ed7f00;Still some quirks remain Very polished and useful application. After entering the source and destination/expense, while adding the note, the fields get reset. Also the graph can be cumulative.
57a08afa5623ed0942ed7f01;Still Ignored Love the material design.. But please bring back the total income / sales in reports and overview section.. Its very useful for small business owners to see how much we earn..
57a08afa5623ed0942ed7f02;Accounts in foreign currencies Unable to have two or more accounts in the same foreign currency. When transferring balances between those 2 accounts, one of them will revert to home currency after 1st transaction.
57a08afa5623ed0942ed7f03;Excellent Still missing a photo upload option :(
57a08afc5623ed0942ed7f04;Great app All my expenses tracked at one place. Loved it..
57a08afc5623ed0942ed7f05;Great design Nice simple layout and navigation. Great for recording spending while on the run
57a08afc5623ed0942ed7f06;Best finance app For a student like me, this is probably the best finance app in the store... Absolutely brilliant and above all it is free!
57a08afc5623ed0942ed7f07;Great app totally for free As someone below noted, sometimes when I fill Note field, other fields reset. Please fix this bug, it will be worth 5 stars
57a08b0b5623ed0942ed7f08;Very good app This app is awesome for Expense management.. But needs lot of update. Better reports are needed.
57a08b0b5623ed0942ed7f09;Great App but missing a few crucial things. I've been using this app almost every day about to become a year next month, love the fact that's very flexible but so far I can only see totals of my expenses in the month, if I want my total income I would have to sit for hours and I have done it, do the math since one of my jobs is based on tips and I write everything down, please when you have free time, work on adding this feature of viewing your total income just like you see your total expenses for the month. I'll update my review later on, thank you
57a08b0d5623ed0942ed7f0a;Would love to see income graphs, and net income per period. It would also be nice if the items on the report can be clicked to show the details for that category per period. But other the best expense tracking app on the store!
57a08b0d5623ed0942ed7f0b;Nice! Great app! Works well! One small change I would like is that the US dollar sign belongs on the left side of the digits, not on the right .... Which is how the rest of the world does it. Thanks for your work!
57a08b0d5623ed0942ed7f0c;Very nice app Helps to know where you spend your money and have a good visual statistics
57a08b115623ed0942ed7f0d;All In One App Great App with good UI, Transfer funds within accounts, easy to use and basic financial transactions facility, latest currency conversion rate, backup my data, has basic security. Please provide facility to choose icons for category
57a08b115623ed0942ed7f0e;Great, but 2 bugs 1) Currencies don't refresh. They're all set to 1:1. I'd like to know how much my foreign accounts equate to. 2) when entering a transaction, most of the details would already be filled (like account and category), but as I enter a note, they're all blank.
57a08b115623ed0942ed7f0f;Great but could use some more features. Beautiful and easy to use. I wish there was some sort of quick-add widget and the ability to set a budget.
57a08b155623ed0942ed7f10;It works It works how it should. The design is amazing as well. More features would make this app even more amazing.
57a08b155623ed0942ed7f11;Excellent Best I've used and I've tried several. To those who say there's no transfer option, under the transactions tab click the red circle icon and it will go green, and again and it will go grey „Äãtransfer. One improvement I'd suggest is a really quick tutorial just to point out less obvious features like that one. But it's clean, attractive, and easy to use.
57a08b155623ed0942ed7f12;Great but missing sort feature Its simply great,but I can not check my all transaction based on category which can be achieved simply by adding sort or filter option. I am looking forward for that feature, please add..I will give it more stars in that case.
57a08b175623ed0942ed7f13;Sync security What about privacy? It's kinda dangerous to sync anything money-related without client-side encryption.
57a08b175623ed0942ed7f14;Almost perfect It would be perfect if when you click in one category, for instance Household, it brings all the expenses applying that filter.
57a08b175623ed0942ed7f15;Search Search option for the past transactions will be awesome.
57a08b175623ed0942ed7f16;I have tried almost all the free expense management on play store. This one is the best. Interface is very smart and goes with android's material design. Though it took me a while to understand the fields. I'm amazed that it's free and without ad.
57a08b1c5623ed0942ed7f17;Navigation bar colour Can the colour of the navigation bar match the status bar's colour? It used to be like that in a previous version.
57a08b1c5623ed0942ed7f18;Wow! Complete the App, we beg you! Best personal finance app for Android - but for two fatal flaws. 1) Tags are *wonderful* for micro-managing spending - but the tag list gets super-long! (If I want to add a tag to Category Restaurant, I have to dig through my entire, huge list to find "Tip." Tags should be assigned to Category so you only see relevant ones.) 2) No way to do transfer between accounts. Yuck! I had to buy My Budget Book just for the account transfer feature - its uglier and harder to use! D:
57a08b1c5623ed0942ed7f19;good Calculator interface is too big and inconvenient to use on big screen phones
57a08b1e5623ed0942ed7f1a;Awesome app,using this for quite some time now.but crashes after last android update.would like to see, credit card, fixed expenses and budget in it.
57a08b1e5623ed0942ed7f1b;No reoccurring fees or salary. It would be nice to have reoccurring fees and salaries.

57a08b275623ed0942ed7f1d;Great App! Been using it for more than an year now. But Please implement a way to get a filtered list of the transactions...like, all transactions linked to an account when clicking on the account name. Or all transactions in a category when clicking on the category name in the report. Please do this if possible!
57a08b275623ed0942ed7f1e;Best Expense Manager.
57a08b275623ed0942ed7f1f;Just what i needed! It's the best expense manager in play store! Readers, don't take this comment negatively. After update, Option for splitting a single expense amount from multiple accounts is gone. I need that feature. It was really helpful. Please bring it back!
57a08b275623ed0942ed7f20;Best
57a08b2a5623ed0942ed7f21;Great app It's great but having income reports and yearly month overview wouldn't hurt.
57a08b2a5623ed0942ed7f22;I really like it just one thing - some icons to attach to categories instead of just colors and it is going to be perfect üëå thanks in advance
57a08b2a5623ed0942ed7f23;Meets need perfectly This app is really helpful. Its goodness lies in its simplicity. I have tried others, but all those where complicated. This is best. Need search option which will make this app complete.
57a08b2e5623ed0942ed7f24;Best financial app for Android This a super useful and easy to use app to put your finances in order. Nice and easy interface.
57a08b2e5623ed0942ed7f25;I was quite happy with this app, until I deleted an "unconfirmed" transaction and my database was totally messed up! I tried to restore my latest backup and my "import" option is invisible. I just can't find it! This is terrible!
57a08b2e5623ed0942ed7f26;One thing.. Just one.. Hope i can add limit budget each category. Then it's perfect!
57a08b2e5623ed0942ed7f27;Minimal and Best Minimalistic. Easy. Better than most of the payed apps out there. Server sync and export features are very convenient. Reports could be improved.
57a08b375623ed0942ed7f28;Great Very helpfull app.
57a08b375623ed0942ed7f29;Very good I looked high and low for finance app to meet my requirements and this one by far is one of the best , need some serious work on UX and some other basic features to be perfect , I want to send developer some ideas, features, enhancements that I'm sure will help improve it even more, auto sync "two ways" using Drive, drop box, specially WebDAV , family sync
57a08b375623ed0942ed7f2a;Good but needs more This app is great but it's missing a few things. It would be nice to see numbers at the peaks of the line graphs on the trends pages.
57a08b405623ed0942ed7f2b;Monthly overview I wish the Transaction tab can be collapsed for every month so I can compare monthly expenses
57a08b405623ed0942ed7f2c;Thank you, I bought you "pop corn"!
57a08b405623ed0942ed7f2d;Simple & elegant I tried many budget apps...most of them was complicated and not for personal use as their description says...this one was perfect for me
57a08b405623ed0942ed7f2e;Awesome Just awesome. it will be great if u can put also a yahoo account I really don't check my Google üòÖ
57a08b405623ed0942ed7f2f;I love this apps so much!
57a08b435623ed0942ed7f30;More reports I like it and I use it, but need also some income reports and advanced reports. Comparing months expenses by categories and so on. Please update and add these features.
57a08b435623ed0942ed7f31;great, but lacking one thing the most suitable app for me. the only important thing that this app doesn't have is to transfer money between accounts
57a08b435623ed0942ed7f32;Need Improvements Missing the important feature Transfer option.
57a08b435623ed0942ed7f33;Day & week view! Please include expense/day&week view!
57a08b455623ed0942ed7f34;Awesome app. Use it everyday.
57a08b455623ed0942ed7f35;Very simple&clean interface to use. Just some minor comments that can make this app amazing: 1. Could add more report types, e.g. report by category 2. Should do have a monthly net-report, factoring in the income.
57a08b455623ed0942ed7f36;Excellent The GUI is impressive
57a08b455623ed0942ed7f37;Good app but very bad programming makes it extremely easy to lose your data. The third complete change they did and second time I can't access my expenses. Also, really bad decisions in changes to the interface.
57a08b475623ed0942ed7f38;Update It is great but it would be even better if there was a way to add monthly recurring payments and a comparison with income and experience after a month. Other then that a great app very simple to use.
57a08b475623ed0942ed7f39;Could use a budget feature When you get the chance you can consider a budget feature that allows users to set a budget for select categories of expenses. It could also alert users when they ate reaching their budget limit . Otherwise this is a very well designed app. Congrats on pulling this off in your spare time and THANKS for making it ad free!
57a08b4f5623ed0942ed7f3a;Recommended ! Beautiful and efficient money tracker. Account manipulation has been implemented brilliantly. Sync makes sure my data is never lost. I have some small requests that would make it even better -- In the categories report menu, if a category is clicked, it should bring up the transactions menu, listing only the transactions of that particular category...The Trends in the overview menu, can be given some click action, like opening the report :D and would love to see some great themes.Thanks!
57a08b4f5623ed0942ed7f3b;Me gusta, es muy sencilla pero intuitiva. Creo que la parte del resumen por cuenta ser√≠a una gran actualizaci√≥n, estar√© a la espera.
57a08b4f5623ed0942ed7f3c;Briliant and intuitive And ad free. Best personal finance app I used
57a08b515623ed0942ed7f3d;Need to Improve It's very useful app for my day to day transactions. Good UI. But we need more from you. 1. Need fund transfer option between the accounts. 2. Bills payable remainder option. 3. Income reports option. 4. Searching option in Day, category, tag and amount wise. 5. Need budget planning option. 6. Quarterly, Halfyearly and Annual reports in categorywise and tagwise. If you will add the above options, Financious is the best finance app.
57a08b515623ed0942ed7f3e;I totally loved the app until the material design update. I wish i could go back to before last update. Even charts doesn't make sense now.
57a08b545623ed0942ed7f3f;Amazing app it will be :) It looks very clean and is easy to use, just some of the features are still lacking (they are on their way as far as I can read). Yet, even withouth the extra features it is highly usable, easy to understand and clean crisp design makes me ahhh! everytime I open it. Well done!
57a08b545623ed0942ed7f40;Awesome I checked out literally 10s of apps before zeroing on this one. Couldn't have asked for a better one. Kindly add the facility to capture the bill images per transaction as well. Thank you
57a08b545623ed0942ed7f41;Needs sync App is really really good, but lacks sync feature.
57a08b585623ed0942ed7f42;The best finance app I've found so far, but Simple and noninvasive, customisable but still straightforward, I love that it backs up to Google, too. NEEDED FEATURES TO MAKE PERFECT PLEASE: instead of just text notes, if we could take pictures of receipts, that would make it perfect. Also, if all the fields are populated, but then I go to add a note, the fields should not reset to no value, they should stay that way.
57a08b585623ed0942ed7f43;It is been the best application for keeping the record of my transaction since last 1 & half year Keep it up developers...
57a08b585623ed0942ed7f44;Thumbs up. Very beautifully designed. One stop solution to manage your finances.
57a08b5d5623ed0942ed7f45;Great way to stay on track This app works well and has a pretty good way of organizating your categories and specific spending. The only thing that would make it better is the ability to change the start date of the weekly overview.
57a08b5d5623ed0942ed7f46;Great but Better to provide an option that can see transactions account wise.
57a08b5d5623ed0942ed7f47;Simple and efficient.
57a08b5d5623ed0942ed7f48;Great but Still missing some features, very helpful though üòÉ
57a08b5f5623ed0942ed7f49;Nice ui. Works well.
57a08b5f5623ed0942ed7f4a;After waiting for one year! Shit This app is very beautiful .. and the last update doesn't make any sense. We need new useful features like.. searhs,reports,security.. I'll go back to old version & waiting for new update ... with respect.
57a08b635623ed0942ed7f4b;Please make tag/category totals!!~~~~ App looks great & works great. Please allow us to view tag/category total costs for any day/week/month/year of our choosing. I need to be able to look back in time and see overall total spendings or earnings. 5 stüåürs when this functionality is added. Would be great to see more in-depth reports too. Otherwise, this app is simple, easy, and a pleasure to use. Up-to-date (Material) design is perfect! üëç Pie charts are a nice touch too. Developer says he is working on improvements and taking feedback, which is great!
57a08b635623ed0942ed7f4c;Useful to keep track Hopefully when you enter to report section and select, let's say clothing, all the expenses related to clothing show up. Like a filter.
57a08b665623ed0942ed7f4d;Great interface, but one big flaw I like the interface, it's clean and neat. However, incomes are treated as if they were expenses. Incomes are not expenses. When you input an income, it should reduce your debt/negative balance, not increase it.
57a08b665623ed0942ed7f4e;Superb All these years I was searching for this app... Simply awesome... Simple... No charges... And very very very efficient... Go ahead... Best wishes for the team
57a08b665623ed0942ed7f4f;superior.. ‡¥Ö‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥™‡µä‡¥≥‡¥ø its different from every application i used for keeping my budget, a search feature in transactions and tags will help more..eventhough high fifr
57a08b685623ed0942ed7f50;Love the app Amazing app. The only thing I would suggest if to add an x acids to the 5 trends chart on the home page
57a08b685623ed0942ed7f51;Awesome!!! Great update! This app is stabil and simple, I love it. The pie chart is clearer the previous one. Thanks for the new color category!
57a08b685623ed0942ed7f52;Nice Tried a couple of other similar apps to keep track of my daily expenses. Decided on this one. Does the job well.
57a08b685623ed0942ed7f53;Are you aware of currency refresh problem? I can't refresh currency and can't change manually. Is there any solution for it or any update you work on? I would appreciate if you can reply.
57a08b6b5623ed0942ed7f54;5 stars for sure( as promised xD) Excellent app that allows cross device sync of all data(transactions and tags etc). Has password lock to keep your business private. Don't go a day without it. Keep up the good work dev!
57a08b6b5623ed0942ed7f55;My data are gone I input my data without signing in, and when I try to sign in using my gmail, apparently all my data's gone. Is there anyway I can get my data back? Appreciate if you can help. I have my whole 3 months worth of expenses there. Thanks!
57a08b6b5623ed0942ed7f56;It would have been a 5 with savings included as part of the priority.
57a08b6e5623ed0942ed7f57;Not able to use. Crashes on each addition of transaction.not able to edit even the existing transaction.
57a08b6e5623ed0942ed7f58;Pending üëç The only app with "Pending" feature plus Material UI.
57a08b6e5623ed0942ed7f59;It's very Good app,but Very Good app. But in every account there muat be shown there transaction.
57a08b6e5623ed0942ed7f5a;Does not support importing from CSV files, a very basic requirement!
57a08b725623ed0942ed7f5b;It's great... But Why is it that when I am entering a transaction, all fields gets populated first, but when I want to enter a new Note then all the previous fields get wiped off and I have to really enter them? Note should be a free text without any link to the rest of the fields in the transaction.
57a08b725623ed0942ed7f5c;More to improve. Best personal finance app overall. Hope i can rearrange tags and categories, need multi acc function to transfer. Otherwise perfect.
57a08b725623ed0942ed7f5d;Its a great app to track your finances but for me only the search functionality would make it a 5* star app!
57a08b725623ed0942ed7f5e;Exactly what I was looking for
57a08b755623ed0942ed7f5f;Best so far and meets my needs I've tested at least 20 different expense manager apps and this one has met my needs so far. I wonder how i can upgrade to the paid version and what features can I enjoy with the paid one?
57a08b755623ed0942ed7f60;Solution for everyone It has the features of many expense tracker. I was using a few and decided to stick to this due to the fact that it supports multiple currency view. Good job dev. Some suggestion that I would improve the ux: 1) summary of monthly expenses on the dashboard rather than acc balance n trending alone. 2) budget allocation for categories.
57a08b755623ed0942ed7f61;5star if you add account transfer option.. Kindly add account transfer option.... It is minimum to an app like this.... Otherwise good app.. Like ur login option... Keep going...üëçüëç
57a08b785623ed0942ed7f62;Please add automatic transactions Would be better if you could add automatic transactions for regular expenses (e.g. rent, bills, repayments).
57a08b785623ed0942ed7f63;Highly recommended! What I like most? It's open source!! :-)
57a08b785623ed0942ed7f64;great job! this is really great app, and you are developing it yourself, congratulations! i am very happy there are different currencies and customization of accounts and the UI is beautiful. i just started using this today so i can't really tell if this app will suit my needs but for now it looks promising. i will be happy to pay for this app in the feature if it turns out to work good, you deserved it! also it would be nice if you put icons for transaction categories. other than that i see no flaws (for now)
57a08b7c5623ed0942ed7f65;Crashes on s5 No categories are shown. When you try to add one it crashes. You need to fix it asap
57a08b7c5623ed0942ed7f66;Best expense manager app! I am using it for 2 years. Great app.
57a08b7c5623ed0942ed7f67;Mantap gan Pros: Beautiful design, can make pending transaction, unlimited wallets, can transfer funds between wallets. Cons: The only sync method is via Google Drive
57a08b7c5623ed0942ed7f68;Love it Love this app the only thing is trying to figure it out can be difficult balance down to the penny but once you get it it's great just wish you could change the dates when you mess up
57a08b805623ed0942ed7f69;The best app but still needs just little improve
57a08b805623ed0942ed7f6a;Nice and useful app Last update (06/2015) is all wrong! Not working properly (reports not working, backup not working, export not working) user interface is terrible, no category search as before... Do not update.... I liked this app before: the interface, overview features, more currencies and accounts feature, category list, ease of use, export possibilities. I would rate full stars but I miss some details: report on income structure (same structured view as with expenses), detailed report on each account. Thanks for this application.
57a08b805623ed0942ed7f6b;Great app It needs a default account feature. I cant be bothered to choose a account every time I record a spending
57a08b845623ed0942ed7f6c;Best personal finance app This is by far, the best personal finance app I have ever downloaded and used. I have tried 90percent of the apps out there, and they are all crap. Well actually crap would be an understatement. If you are like me and have the need to keep track of your daily expenses, add funds and view reports all in the most simple way possible DOWNLOAD THIS APP.
57a08b845623ed0942ed7f6d;Great app, free and no ads. Thanks!
57a08b845623ed0942ed7f6e;Can't Restore Backup. I was using this for my accounts from 6 months. Had to format my phone so took a backup. I am not able to restore the backup now as I have the latest update. Please fix this. Its frustrating that you lost all your data bcuz the app doesn't restore its own backup file.
57a08b8a5623ed0942ed7f6f;It got worse after last update Until last updates it was good, but now there are some inconveniences. For example, when I enter notes all selected fields become empty. Very annoying modification, add an option to disable autofilling.
57a08b8a5623ed0942ed7f70;Great
57a08b8e5623ed0942ed7f71;Simplicity at its best! Very easy to use, and the UI is just great.
57a08b8e5623ed0942ed7f72;Suggestions So far the only completely free app without ads I've found. Would love to see option for transfer from one account to another and lending/borrowing management. Loving it for what it already offers. Edit: I found a workaround for both these features (include in reports thing), however, now I think a category wise transaction list and search feature would be nice :)
57a08b8e5623ed0942ed7f73;Simply perfect Please add transfer and search by category+tags filter.
57a08b915623ed0942ed7f74;Maybe still a little too simple Could benefit from more options like mass tag modification and other features. Plain, simple and intuitive nonetheless.
57a08b915623ed0942ed7f75;Slick and cool Added my girlfriend as a tag. Now it can tell when the expense is related to my gf 10/10
57a08b915623ed0942ed7f76;Not working after latest update.... very poor...
57a08b915623ed0942ed7f77;Good app Find option needed in transaction
57a08b945623ed0942ed7f78;crashes on entering transactions after last update, every time i tried to enter transactions from left side menu, app was force closed. i was using it before, will try to find better now...
57a08b945623ed0942ed7f79;Fantastic App Love the latest update. Perfect!
57a08b945623ed0942ed7f7a;Transfer money between accounts How can i transfer money between accounts... Before update the function exists but i am not able to find it right now... Replay please.
57a08b945623ed0942ed7f7b;The app is very useful and nicely designed. And free! Unfortunately the exchange rates have been broken for a few months now. Please fix it! 2 stars until then.
57a08b985623ed0942ed7f7c;Awsome App
57a08b985623ed0942ed7f7d;Waiting for category wise filter Very nice and uncluttered app... will give 5 stars when you will give category wise filter for transactions
57a08b985623ed0942ed7f7e;A few downsides Would be nice to be able to assign tags to categories. Now it's pretty insane to scroll all the way down to assign the tag which suits only to one category and this category has only two tags. Also would be nice, but not necessary, to assign spent sums to tags also. Now I have more than ten transactions each with different tag assigned and different sums instead of one transaction with a lot of tags and their assigned sums. Auto sync is a must. Overall it's pretty nice app.
57a08b9b5623ed0942ed7f7f;Good and stable A desktop version and multiple device sync would be nice. Also being able to quickly change overview from daily weekly and monthly without going into settings would be nice
57a08b9b5623ed0942ed7f80;Simple, Cool & Neat Expense Manager A decent app.I was looking for something more like add more accounts & view into the details of the added accounts, which is currently missing. Guys please come up with this so I can come back to you......
57a08b9b5623ed0942ed7f81;Simple but nicely done. You have a good product that only needs a bit improving on some areas. Keep up the good work. Also please remove prefilled fields
57a08b9d5623ed0942ed7f82;Disappointed my setting & data all lost when upgraded to new version
57a08b9d5623ed0942ed7f83;Total income Can you add a feature that can show the total income. I want to know both income and expanses
57a08b9d5623ed0942ed7f84;Wow.. Simply SUPERB..
57a08b9d5623ed0942ed7f85;Excellent Good jop .
57a08b9d5623ed0942ed7f86;GOOD APP this app help me manager my work very nice, thanks for this app
57a08ba05623ed0942ed7f87;Decent for the simple stuff. I miss filtering the history by category.
57a08ba05623ed0942ed7f88;Features missing Excellent design and interface but with lack of transfer feature it's quite a hassle to use.
57a08ba05623ed0942ed7f89;Was great until the last update. The app was great and worked perfectly until the last update (over a month ago). Ever since it started crashing every time I try to add a new entry. I've tried reloading my saved data and also starting from a fresh re install and it crashes very time. Hope you fix it
57a08ba05623ed0942ed7f8a;I lost everything after I login All my record I saved is lost after I login. How could the app be setup like this?
57a08ba35623ed0942ed7f8b;Good App is pretty much well equipped with several features. However, one thing I miss is the ability to attach a picture of the receipt to the expense log.
57a08ba35623ed0942ed7f8c;Good interface but lacks important features Requires transfer feature to transfer funds from one account to another (for eg while paying a credit card.) And needs a search feature. These 2 things would make it the best expense management app out there.
57a08ba35623ed0942ed7f8d;Add feature It would be nice to see when the transaction has been confirmed after set it on pending
57a08ba65623ed0942ed7f8e;Great app. Very easy to use. The app is very good. Want to give a suggestion, please provide filter for transactions. It is hard to search hundreds of records by scrolling down. It would be nice if transactions can be viewed period wise by swiping left to right or right to left, for example like category view. If possible please add bills remainder option too having bill date, due date and amount details.
57a08ba65623ed0942ed7f8f;The "Restore" feature disappeared! Why?
57a08ba65623ed0942ed7f90;Excellent app for personal accounting It does what it should do without any hassle. UI is simple and app is very intuitive. They need to add a photo option to add in each transaction (receipt, etc.)
57a08ba95623ed0942ed7f91;Great app Good app for those on a budget. Update allows you to make your own categories. Love it!
57a08ba95623ed0942ed7f92;Easy and Superb! This is the only one I can fully adopt to my needs. Very comfortable, friendly and there is no any garbage. Highly recommend! Big thanks to Devs!
57a08ba95623ed0942ed7f93;How to restore my old data with this new version already i using this apps my old device, in my new how to i restore this data. it not supporting
57a08bab5623ed0942ed7f94;Nice and great app
57a08bab5623ed0942ed7f95;Simple and efficient Almost 5 stars, but I don't like the fact that on transactions the previous data (tags and account) are already filled in. But that's just a preference thing. Otherwise the best money manager app I've come across.
57a08bab5623ed0942ed7f96;This App Is Awesome :) Financius is best app for tracking my earning & spending nowadays. Keep the great work dear developer. Juice! :).
57a08bab5623ed0942ed7f97;Category duplicated After update, there are duplicated categories with different color. It is confusing.
57a08bb25623ed0942ed7f98;in general useful, but... previously I liked it better... now it does not show how much is the total income... I needed that as well...
57a08bb75623ed0942ed7f99;Sleek, Simple and Efficient Finance budget app!!! For functionality I rate it 5 stars and there's also room for minimal improvements. On the add transaction panel I recommend to make the switch button (debit/credit/transfer) larger because I find it hard at first time use how to change transaction type and also add simple User Guide on settings menu. I also suggest more report options on report section. Overall, it is great app and easy to use with its sleek material design.
57a08bb75623ed0942ed7f9a;Missing a piece Very good app. Just missing something which was in a previous version and made me chose this very app over some of the same kind, is the balance with your earning to compare how much you earn with your spending.
57a08bb75623ed0942ed7f9b;Great app A budget management feature would be great!
57a08bba5623ed0942ed7f9c;Amazingly good! Awesome overview screen. Easy account management Does not sum up actual balance correctly, when using two diff currencies. Counts all as a single currency UPDATE: increased mark to 4 stars. It all works if starting anew. Bad that it did not allow flawless usage of the app after restoring from a backup UPDATE 2: the addition of cloud syncing makes this a go-to app, perfect, thanks
57a08bba5623ed0942ed7f9d;Can't open my financius after installing the new update " unfortunately financius has stopped working " please fix ASAP!!!!! Need this app, been working with it for months.
57a08bba5623ed0942ed7f9e;Awesome Very very nice app.. a kind suggestion.. create a daily reminder settings which remind to enter expenses..
57a08bbc5623ed0942ed7f9f;This app used to be amazing until the recent updates. I'm searching for an alternative app.
57a08bbc5623ed0942ed7fa0;Great app! Beautiful and simple to use. I'd give it five stars if it had categories detailed per month and yearly reports. Thanks for the great work:-)
57a08bbc5623ed0942ed7fa1;I don't know why, but.... my data connection seems to be affected by the update in a bad way. It seems to cut off from time to time. Never happened before the update. I suspect the new synchronization feature has to do with it. Please fix it.
57a08bc05623ed0942ed7fa2;Stupid update!!! The developers have gone mad!! Have you guys ever heard about user acceptance test or UAT ?!? How could you make a moderately efficient app so stupid?!? For example I have only one account still I need to click and select that one damn account?!? If I select food category and want groceries as tag then I will have to scroll from a to g all tags?!? Why?!! I have selected food show the tags relevant!! Why do I need to select account if I have only one?!? Searching for an alternative will uninstall asap.
57a08bc05623ed0942ed7fa3;Look no further. You want to keep track of your expenses? This is the app you need. A word to the dev: thank you for sharing this wonderful app with us FOR FREE. It's a shame people demand new features from an already free app.
57a08bc05623ed0942ed7fa4;Simple and efficient. I love it!
57a08bc25623ed0942ed7fa5;Category report Why can't we see the individual transactions by clicking on the categories? I want to see what did I buy under health and beauty this month, for example. This should be a very basic function
57a08bc25623ed0942ed7fa6;Hated all the new updates! I love the app dont get me wrong but the updates are just crazy! You should bring the total earnings back so we could see our balance! Also, the most used category filter so you wont have to scroll to all the categories. What the app needs as well. In the reports. Maybe you could add a feature where you can just tap a category and you will see all the entries that was made to it.
57a08bc75623ed0942ed7fa7;Good but... The latest update removed some stuff that I liked and considered relevant. 1) I cannot see how much I spent on a certain day, 2) The transactions are not divided in to days anymore (I know I can still change the settings to per day but the old version didnt require it)
57a08bc75623ed0942ed7fa8;Not working after update Galaxy Note2 I like this app it makes my life easier, but after updating it now it keep crash and not working and now arround 2 years of fin data may lost
57a08bc75623ed0942ed7fa9;Where is my app? Why is this app icon disappear after updated it?
57a08bc75623ed0942ed7faa;Le ¬´ Money ¬ª de monsieur tout le monde Simple et efficace, permet de budgeter sans se prendre la t√™te. Mention sp√©ciale √† l'interface.
57a08bca5623ed0942ed7fab;Nice.. but .. Previous circular bar was good compared to new one. Love to see only transactions related one catagory. When clicked on category while viewing reports.
57a08bca5623ed0942ed7fac;the best... simple and easy... and now very convenient because of the sync feature. great job!!!
57a08bca5623ed0942ed7fad;Needs improvement I have been waiting for update, to have category detailed view per month and yearly report, for very long and it doesn't seem to be happening.
57a08bca5623ed0942ed7fae;Good application Dear Mantas, what does the server synchronisation do?
57a08bcc5623ed0942ed7faf;The best. Functionality and ui wise it is the best finance app. Easy to use. You can customise currencies,add tags, back and restore. Neat and attention to detail is very good. Oh and the UI is really top notch material design as you can see from the screenshots.
57a08bcc5623ed0942ed7fb0;The best!
57a08bcc5623ed0942ed7fb1;Synchronize Works! Thank you for this feature, it's work between my phone and tablet.
57a08bcf5623ed0942ed7fb2;Best expenses manager Better than any similap apps I've used before
57a08bcf5623ed0942ed7fb3;Lost all my data After update this morning, I lost all my data!!! This is so terrible. Since the developer disable the backup function, so I cannot get back my data at all. I used to donate to you for your wonderful work, but I'm very disappointed and angry now. looking forward to a fix. any plan to give back my data?
57a08bcf5623ed0942ed7fb4;Hoping for improvement. I've used this app for 2 years. It's the best simplest financial app imo. Would like to see more improvement. I'll suggest more on the statistics such as search & filter feature. New feature such as budgets & notification once budget reached are also high upgrade to this app. Cool app btw
57a08bd25623ed0942ed7fb5;Old version 5 star There is no balance in overview.....why??? I want to know how much money i can spend.
57a08bd25623ed0942ed7fb6;Perfect for personal finance management.
57a08bd25623ed0942ed7fb7;Add automatic income and automatic expenses!!! Why is there no automatic income!? There should ALWAYS be an automatic expenses and automatic income option on ANY professional Expenses Manager. I get a salary deposit every 2 weeks and there is no option for this. Also, there are monthly expenses like cable, internet, cell phone and other finite expenses that is an EXTREME hassle re-entering every single week. Worst and most unprofessional app out there for expenses.
57a08be35623ed0942ed7fb8;Loved it
57a08be35623ed0942ed7fb9;Addiction maximized My daughter (a Mathie) told me about this game. I am happy there is an undo button now. I wish this version were available for the Kindle.
57a08be35623ed0942ed7fba;Super ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
57a08be35623ed0942ed7fbb;Undo feature slows down app
57a08be35623ed0942ed7fbc;Good idea. +1 for Open Source. Edit: Cannot stand blurriness anymore.
57a08be45623ed0942ed7fbd;Lag city
57a08be45623ed0942ed7fbe;Ad free port of the original open source game.
57a08be45623ed0942ed7fbf;Addictive I first became a fan of this game when i got an app that u had to earn coins to unlock diffrent colored lights. How u got coins was to play games and it just happened tbat one of the mini games was this kind of game!!!
57a08be45623ed0942ed7fc0;Keeps crashing Since I upgraded my android this game keeps crashing.
57a08be45623ed0942ed7fc1;love it.. good excercise before i go to work..
57a08be75623ed0942ed7fc2;Slow Since latest update, it's moving very slow. The animations are fine, but the time it takes from my finger movement to display is too slow. I was already moving ahead of the animations before, but now I don't even want to play due to the latency.
57a08be75623ed0942ed7fc3;Too easy and too slow Being able to undo just one move should be enough to correct false moves, 50 is ridiculous and makes the game annoyingly slow. 3 moves and everybody is happy, yes? Oh and the occasional dropping of 4 has ruined many a game. The undo button took me from a high score of 73000ish to 290552 in one game, finally defeated by a dropped 4.
57a08be75623ed0942ed7fc4;Fundamental flaw Sometimes drops a 4 instead of a 2. I suspect the error is in the source code because another ad free version does the same. A bothersome glitch.
57a08bf95623ed0942ed7fc5;The only game I never uninstall
57a08bf95623ed0942ed7fc6;Highly recommended A wonderful collection of brain-teasing puzzles all in one app. I play this all the time because there's so much variation you can never get bored. Suggestion: Could 'Reveal solution' be a button not on a menu so we can see where we went wrong visibly correct itself. Helpful when learning a game.
57a08bf95623ed0942ed7fc7;Absolutely love this little app! Had this on my old phone and redownloaded it for my new one. I love it. Lots of intelligent puzzles. The only thing I would love a timer if it was possible for the puzzles. Esp Slant. I can play that for hours. Would love the option to challenge myself to beat puzzles faster. Great app. Simple to use with clear instructions.
57a08bfb5623ed0942ed7fc8;Lots of puzzles, simple UI, no ads
57a08bfb5623ed0942ed7fc9;An excellent little collection Great to play when you're bored and you want something fun to do on your phone that doesn't drain the battery. Controls can be a little annoying when you have to switch between tap and long press all the time. Overall, I highly recommend these games.
57a08bfb5623ed0942ed7fca;My desert island app I've been playing Galaxies daily since I found this collection. It was not immediately obvious, but there are size and difficulty options for most of the puzzles. Galaxies and some others even offer custom sizes with ridiculous upper boundaries. The collection reminds me of the best nineties shareware: quiet, minimal, and intuitive, yet offering basically infinite challenge.
57a08bfd5623ed0942ed7fcb;Awesome classic puzzle games! Simply done so it's about the puzzles, not the graphics. There should be more apps like this!
57a08bfd5623ed0942ed7fcc;Una app muy simple y entretenida Los puzzles son muy ingeniosos, con varios niveles de dificultad.
57a08bfd5623ed0942ed7fcd;Excellent Great games
57a08bfd5623ed0942ed7fce;my favourite game app. low battery usage and customisablity huge +es.
57a08bfe5623ed0942ed7fcf;Download immediately I don't normally leave descriptions but this game is amazing. All the puzzles you love with no ads. If you're checking comments to decide whether to download, then yes, download now.
57a08bfe5623ed0942ed7fd0;Lots of choices. No ads!
57a08bfe5623ed0942ed7fd1;Perfect No ads. No microtransactions. Just many puzzle games with fully adjustable difficulty in one nice package. If you like puzzle games, get this game now!
57a08c015623ed0942ed7fd2;Stellar app The customizability, ease of use, lack of ads, multitude of games, and randomly generated puzzles makes this the best app, by far, for any puzzler. My only complaint is that within Black Box, there is no option to automatically fire the laser beams after generating a puzzle. But even this is very minor and only begins to show itself in the larger grids. 10/10 overall and in almost every category. Thanks for this amazing app, and I look forward to the future of it!
57a08c015623ed0942ed7fd3;I spend hours on these Free, no ads, doesn't use my data, and fun!
57a08c015623ed0942ed7fd4;Best app
57a08c045623ed0942ed7fd5;I don't normally do ratings... But when I do.. it's a game that I spent time playing and I still want more. Has no ads and is enjoyable and challenging. Doesn't make you feel like you have to play it all the time but it comes on your mind when you have some downtime - I could solve a puzzle or two! Definitely recommended. I'd say one of the few must have games for your android that you'll keep for a looong time because it just never gets old
57a08c045623ed0942ed7fd6;Best ever! Neat job! Gives hopes on human kind!
57a08c045623ed0942ed7fd7;some of the puzzles are a little confusing
57a08c045623ed0942ed7fd8;Just the perfect game app to kill time
57a08c065623ed0942ed7fd9;Fantastic. :) Loved it. Great games. Playable offline. No ads. Millions of game possibilities.
57a08c065623ed0942ed7fda;Love this app Been using this app for over a year. Tons of great puzzels. I do wish it had more difficulty levels for some of the puzzles though
57a08c065623ed0942ed7fdb;One of the most addictive apps ever I have spent so much time playing the absolute Miriad of puzzles included.
57a08c065623ed0942ed7fdc;Simply the best I have been enjoying this puzzle pack on my computer for many years now. It is simply the most well rounded puzzle pack in existence. The fact that it now fits in my purse is simply amazing.
57a08c075623ed0942ed7fdd;loved it and love it Thanks Chris! Great job :)
57a08c075623ed0942ed7fde;A wonderful time killer with good controls and a wide variety of games. However, it would REALLY benefit from a "play random game" button.
57a08c075623ed0942ed7fdf;Nice collection of puzzles
57a08c075623ed0942ed7fe0;Hours of entertainment! A wide variety of puzzles and a very simple interface make for a great app to have anytime there is time to be killed.
57a08c0a5623ed0942ed7fe1;Review updated June 2016: now 39 games AND pinch-to-zoom! This is the one game app I put on every single device I own. Awesome app. These puzzles are loads of fun - like the author put it, they work great as little "toys" to help pass the time. Having them on my phone is even better! Touch interface works really well, although larger puzzles are easier to control with a tablet even though there's pinch zoom. Definitely recommended.
57a08c0a5623ed0942ed7fe2;Great games No ads!
57a08c0a5623ed0942ed7fe3;Give 5 stars without thinking! What will value more than almost 40 puzzle game in 1 and no ads!
57a08c0b5623ed0942ed7fe4;Simply the best
57a08c0b5623ed0942ed7fe5;My favorite tablet app I love this on my galaxy tab. I use it on my phone as well. No ads is awesome
57a08c0b5623ed0942ed7fe6;Awesome! So many puzzle types, so much variation, all generated on demand so you never run out and it never repeats. Awesome!!
57a08c0b5623ed0942ed7fe7;wow!!! awesome!!! thank you soo much!!!
57a08c0b5623ed0942ed7fe8;Excellent puzzle package It has all my favorite logic puzzles and some I never knew existed. Beyond a few control tweaks this game is polished.
57a08c0e5623ed0942ed7fe9;So good! Addiction.
57a08c0e5623ed0942ed7fea;Amazing Simon Love your work! From the amazing putty client, though to these time wasting but well implemented games.
57a08c0e5623ed0942ed7feb;Excellent. I play only one game on this really but because it always generates a new grid every time I'll always be playing it.
57a08c0e5623ed0942ed7fec;Best app ever Open source, no ads, low memory usage, great games. What more could you want?
57a08c0f5623ed0942ed7fed;Wish I could give it more stars. The best collection of games/puzzles out there.
57a08c0f5623ed0942ed7fee;Fun, free and spam free! I'd pay for this if it wasn't free. Simple uncluttered interface and lots of fun and challenging logic type puzzles. All the classics are here.
57a08c0f5623ed0942ed7fef;Best of its kind Love it
57a08c0f5623ed0942ed7ff0;Great collection, thank you
57a08c0f5623ed0942ed7ff1;Classics Controls work well
57a08c115623ed0942ed7ff2;Awesom app
57a08c115623ed0942ed7ff3;Fantastic Not a pretty app but I really don't care, a great selection of puzzles and a great way to pass some time.
57a08c115623ed0942ed7ff4;Brilliant game if you love puzzles! This has no ads, loads of favourites and other puzzles. Better than the rest.
57a08c115623ed0942ed7ff5;Well built puzzle app No beautiful deco or background, but hit the very right spot being a puzzle game. Control is pretty well designed, and with customize levels for all games. Superb!
57a08c135623ed0942ed7ff6;Great stuff!
57a08c135623ed0942ed7ff7;Best collection! This one app has a better collection of great puzzles than EVERYTHING else I've seen on the play store, combined!
57a08c135623ed0942ed7ff8;LUV IT SO MUCH!!! BEST TIME KILLERS!!!!
57a08c135623ed0942ed7ff9;Awesome Havent seen a better logic puzzle collection
57a08c135623ed0942ed7ffa;Low App Size Love it - that, combined with no ads is wonderful. Couldn't fall back
57a08c155623ed0942ed7ffb;Absolute best collection of puzzles While the graphics aren't as flashy as some others, there are so many different kinds of puzzles at various levels of difficulty and they are self-generating so you never run out!
57a08c155623ed0942ed7ffc;Best puzzles! I love all of the games in this collection. Being able to dynamically generate any puzzle with custom sizes or types is a huge bonus too!
57a08c155623ed0942ed7ffd;Great, but not entirely. Has several games that are a lot of fun to play. Unfortunately, the other 80% of the games available are either too confusing or just frustratingly annoying to play. But still, there are plenty there to keep me happy and entertained when I'm in the mood. Good job!
57a08c185623ed0942ed7ffe;Absolutely hours of the best logic games out there in the kindest simplest theme ever. Thank you
57a08c185623ed0942ed7fff;Terrific fun Each game takes only a little time to understand but longer to get good at. Very challenging puzzles, and lots of variety. Great for brain exercise! This is one of my favorite apps.
57a08c185623ed0942ed8000;Best of its kind! A very thorough collection of all of the best logic puzzles, plus several that I had never seen before.
57a08c185623ed0942ed8001;Literally the best app My favorite app, keeps me sane, worth thousands of dollars of Sudoku puzzle books.
57a08c195623ed0942ed8002;How is that even free Holy heck
57a08c195623ed0942ed8003;Huge collection of puzzles Tons of options for all levels of play.
57a08c195623ed0942ed8004;If you want a sharper brain, download this now!
57a08c195623ed0942ed8005;The best I have installed in one form or another on every device I have. Excellent puzzles, well implemented and huge variety make it a permanent feature.
57a08c1c5623ed0942ed8006;Everything I was looking for, and light app Excellent variety of logic games, simple gameplay, had no ads (despite being a free app) and was also light on battery. Requires no wifi connection, as it's a collection of small one-player puzzles, and easy to play on the go.
57a08c1c5623ed0942ed8007;Be advised: very addictive :-)
57a08c1c5623ed0942ed8008;No frills, just good. I have my favourites that I keep going back to again and again. There are lots of puzzles for every ability, and no ads anywhere! It really is a bare-bones proposition. The help is a text file, and there are no hints. If you're stuck, you can always jump to the solution. That's not a hint, but it can help you determine techniques. I would be willing to contribute a couple dollars for this app.
57a08c1e5623ed0942ed8009;Freezes your device Updated review, had a problem with this freezing my device but uninstalled/ re-installed and fingers crossed working perfectly again. Great range of puzzles only problem is its soooo hard to put down
57a08c1e5623ed0942ed800a;Great puzzles Plenty to choose from and several levels in each. Great for 5 mins break or an hour's puzzling. Best puzzles I've downloaded so far
57a08c1e5623ed0942ed800b;Best game app ever! No ads, no bugs, lots of different games so never gets old. Love this app! Don't change a thing!
57a08c1e5623ed0942ed800c;Awesome! Perfect! Even minesweeper is better then Windows' one!
57a08c205623ed0942ed800d;my fav game collection I stumbled upon this a few years ago when it came with Linux OS for PC. I've been hooked since then and happy to have found it for Android as well. Highly recommended! &lt;3
57a08c205623ed0942ed800e;Awesome, simple, love it. Great selection of games without the flash. Best puzzle app I have.
57a08c205623ed0942ed800f;Excellent This is crazy! So many games. All in one app? Wow! This is amazing. Superb work. All games designed well!
57a08c205623ed0942ed8010;I've only used this for a day, but I really appreciate how quickly I can get in, do a puzzle, and then get out.
57a08c225623ed0942ed8011;Amazing The graphics aren't great but there's a massive variety of games. Great for killing time.
57a08c225623ed0942ed8012;Great collection This is the way it should be. No intrusive advertising, gratifying gameplay and varying difficulties of each puzzle. Loopy is my personal favourite!
57a08c225623ed0942ed8013;Could be added that game to spot the square of different shade (kuku kube)?
57a08c225623ed0942ed8014;10+stars üåå This is the best collection of puzzles with no ads and great AI üòä‚ò∫. Thank you Simon. You rock üôå
57a08c235623ed0942ed8015;Just perfect.
57a08c235623ed0942ed8016;I just love it. So compact. In just an app.
57a08c235623ed0942ed8017;Crap Awfuk
57a08c235623ed0942ed8018;Simple with tons of variety
57a08c235623ed0942ed8019;OMG I think I'm in heaven ;)
57a08c265623ed0942ed801a;A Classic. Assembling all the puzzles in one app, with highly customisable settings, and it even comes with its own instruction manual, offline & no ads.
57a08c265623ed0942ed801b;Addictive! I have this on my tablet and am adding it to my phone. A nice range of challenging puzzles to engage your brain and no ridiculous, flashing nonsense or insufferable adverts. If this had initially been on a free trial basis I'd pay to keep it.
57a08c265623ed0942ed801c;Puzzles are great, no ads, what's not to like?
57a08c265623ed0942ed801d;What more can someone ask for? Free, no ads, smooth game without unnecessary animations. The puzzles are pretty fun too.
57a08c275623ed0942ed801e;Lotsa fun! Great collection of games.
57a08c275623ed0942ed801f;Excellent No extra permissions required, great one
57a08c275623ed0942ed8020;Good variety Fun collection of distractions
57a08c275623ed0942ed8021;Great compilation A great collection of many great puzzles. Lots of customization, lots of replayability
57a08c275623ed0942ed8022;EXACTLY what we ask for! A bunch of games for free with absolutely no ads!? Yes please! !
57a08c295623ed0942ed8023;Best app ever! Simple but complete. Thank you!
57a08c295623ed0942ed8024;Great App The equivalent of owning ten other game apps, in a single compact space
57a08c295623ed0942ed8025;Perfect in every way Fun puzzle games that you can have on anything. No tracking, no only online. Just you and your puzzles. Best minesweeper implementation I seen bar none.
57a08c295623ed0942ed8026;Awesome! I'd give 6 stars if I could
57a08c2b5623ed0942ed8027;Wow! A great variety of puzzle games What a pleasure. Ads-free puzzles from easy to very difficult. The controls work well, even on my small mobile phone screen, despite the growing size as I progress to the larger challenges. Thanks for collecting and presenting them.
57a08c2b5623ed0942ed8028;Incredible How can this possibly be free?! Every game is engaging. Great interface, well documented, no ads!
57a08c2b5623ed0942ed8029;Best game on the app store Truely no ads or IAPs, which is amazing. Every puzzle is fun and challenging, and the customization is fantastic, allowing you to tailor the game to your preference. ZERO complaints, would highly recommend.
57a08c2d5623ed0942ed802a;Great And somehow free
57a08c2d5623ed0942ed802b;Favorite app I have If this wasn't free I'd buy it. It's bare bones but if you like logic games and aren't invested in GUIs, you should download this.

57a08c375623ed0942ed803d;Free It is free. Nuff said
57a08c375623ed0942ed803e;had to re rate 5 stars perfect free game entertaining and long life games, really worth a download and developers you need to consider charging nothing to expensive but 10p a download would still be a bargain
57a08c375623ed0942ed803f;Puzzle Maniak Not sure, but is this a follow up to puzzle maniak? Anyway, really like it. But is there a way to make the error markings (mostly in red) optional so you could turn it on/off during a game?
57a08c375623ed0942ed8040;The best set of free puzzles with no ads or iap

57a08c395623ed0942ed8043;Perfect algorithms... First game must have been a fluke or I must have missed something. 10 more games on hard and no stale mates. Good algorithms. Only thing that could be improved is the look.

57a08c3c5623ed0942ed8047;Great There is no reason for less than five stars. The app is free and doesnt have any ads. The instructions for the games could be a little better but I like to figure things out on my own anyway. I have yet to find any bugs in any of the games.
57a08c3c5623ed0942ed8048;What a gift! Had never seen the Towers game before, and it was love at first sight, and that's only one of these challenging puzzles. All this and no ads! Can only hope it stays that way. Kudos to its creator(s)!
57a08c3c5623ed0942ed8049;Excellent!
57a08c3f5623ed0942ed804a;Best. Game. Ever. No exaggeration. No ads, easy on the battery, everything is customisable and easy to navigate. Game appears slightly crude, but rest assured what IS there is magnificent. 39 customisable games, from easy and master-able to tricky enough to where there's several games modes I'm scared to try in hard mode. Best game I have ever seen! This is what game makers should strive for!!

57a08c3f5623ed0942ed804c;Update Still awesome. Keen is my favorite. Highly addicting
57a08c415623ed0942ed804d;The only game you need I have played this game for years! If I had to pay a cent for every hour of this enjoyment this app has given me, it would cost me a lot of money, but thankfully it is free! :)
57a08c415623ed0942ed804e;Love it! I really like it, the puzzles are fun, and best of all, IT'S FREE. But I'm dumb and some of the puzzles I can't get the hang of, even if I read the instructions 50 times. But anyway, It's great fun, and definitely a wonderful app. Keep it up! üòä
57a08c415623ed0942ed804f;Unadulterated Collection of puzzles with good documentation, uncorrupted by monetization.
57a08c415623ed0942ed8050;The best puzzle collection ever.
57a08c435623ed0942ed8051;Love it I get it installed in any Linux or Android system that I have.
57a08c435623ed0942ed8052;If you like thinking, this is the app for you Hours of fun
57a08c435623ed0942ed8053;Fantastic, addictive Brilliant puzzles. Nicely balanced with skill levels to suit beginners to experts. Can't get enough of them.
57a08c435623ed0942ed8054;Incredible App All in one logic game Worth 5 stars
57a08c435623ed0942ed8055;Wow I absolutely love it! Especially the special version of minesweeper! Less frustrating but more challenging
57a08c455623ed0942ed8056;Great Variety My boyfriend is always stealing my tablet to play this game.
57a08c455623ed0942ed8057;Perfect
57a08c455623ed0942ed8058;All time favourite First day I got a tablet, downloaded this. Five years later, its the only thing I still have. Many games come and go - this is like an old friend. No money, no WiFi, no adds, no time issues just fun. Can set games from easy time filler right up to near impossible as you like
57a08c455623ed0942ed8059;Wow A huge variety, well programmed, lots of fun. Amazing app
57a08c485623ed0942ed805a;Still playing I got this app almost a year ago and I still play it often. I like the new puzzle, Palisade, but I think the line color contrast needs adjusted. The green lines should be more distinguishable from the gray lines in day mode, since groups of connected squares are more important than they were in Loopy. Right now it's hard to tell how many squares I already have in each group.
57a08c485623ed0942ed805b;What a free app should be Ad free, not pay to win, fun, enjoyable, doesnt need any permissions. Not bloated either. If you are looking at this, just get the puzzles already!
57a08c485623ed0942ed805c;Great collection These are not original puzzles and do not have a well polished presentation. But any puzzle fan will love this package! I've seen many of these puzzles being sold in Google store before without a single mention on its source of inspiration.
57a08c4a5623ed0942ed805d;Thank You Amazing of you to make this free. Wow. No complaints
57a08c4a5623ed0942ed805e;Love the puzzles Unlike most apps, this has a large variety of puzzles rather than just one. The difficulty can be changed to suit every ability level. A new puzzle was just added, and I'm addicted to it already! If I could, I'd give this app 10 Stars.
57a08c4a5623ed0942ed805f;A fun set of puzzles to play. This is a fun set of puzzles to play with, it includes many great puzzles for free, all in one app, no ads, no micro transactions, no crap. Each puzzle also includes a nice help section.
57a08c4d5623ed0942ed8060;Perfect I honestly love it, the variety is awesome, and it being ACTUALLY free makes me feel happy that the creators of this app just like fun puzzle games and think that that should be all there is to it. I wish more companies worked like this one does. Great job
57a08c4d5623ed0942ed8061;Excellent mix very nice combination of games. No ads or annoyances. Makes installing of many other games unnecessary. For years now!
57a08c4d5623ed0942ed8062;Excellent
57a08c515623ed0942ed8063;Incredible Value Lots of games, bound to be something for everyone. I'm loving Undead atm. Algorithm generated puzzles ensure you never run out. All for free. Incredible. Thank you.
57a08c515623ed0942ed8064;Great One of a very few apps I can recommend without any reservations. Exactly the type of app I'll keep over many different phones. Simple and does exactly what I want.
57a08c535623ed0942ed8065;Awesome Interface improvements a few versions ago are subtle but sweet. Great set of puzzles - something for everyone...
57a08c535623ed0942ed8066;Awesome Simon is true geek of programming. Visit his webpage. You will be motivated for writing small and powerful applications and mainly thinking different logic which are out of the box.
57a08c535623ed0942ed8067;A superb collectiin of puzzles. Don't let the simple graphics fool you: These puzzles are excellent and well designed.
57a08c535623ed0942ed8068;Must have Love these brain teasers
57a08c555623ed0942ed8069;Kudos I have this for one game NET. Very challenging! Play on highest setting but have to long press as I go along (you'll see what I mean but advise starting on the easiest and working up). GG to dev on this.
57a08c555623ed0942ed806a;Literally my favorite app of all time. A large variety of challenging & fun puzzles with ZERO ads, microtransactions, or initial costs. Ironically, that makes it one of the few apps I wish I could shovel money at.
57a08c675623ed0942ed806b;Does everything I need Can easily find and download all my favorite podcasts so I can listen without having to be connected. Good user interface. I used an ipod touch for years and I think this app is going to allow me to just use my phone for podcasts now.
57a08c675623ed0942ed806c;Perfect podcast app This has all the features I need in a podcast app, very clean and simple UI, lightweight and ad free. What more can you ask for? Absolutely prefect in my opinion!
57a08c675623ed0942ed806d;Fast podcast app Antennapod was usable in my quite slow older android phone . In the new one it seems to be running very smoothly. And its simple and easy to use. Appreciate it. :)
57a08c695623ed0942ed806e;Well suited I've been using AntennaPod for about 6 months and I have found that it well suited to collecting and listening to podcasts. I try to use open source whenever I can but sometimes find the applications to be very rough and difficult to navigate. This is not the case with antennapod so I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a straightforward and dependable podcast manager.
57a08c695623ed0942ed806f;Best in class! The search is over- after several auditions we have a winner.
57a08c695623ed0942ed8070;Works great I'm glad I found this enjoyable easy to use podcaster.
57a08c695623ed0942ed8071;Organised, clean UI. Reliable. Works well. Thank you developers.
57a08c6a5623ed0942ed8072;Works great on Galaxy S7. Ad free is a plus too.
57a08c6a5623ed0942ed8073;Easy to use and works well. Great app that I use during my walking.
57a08c6a5623ed0942ed8074;Still rocks On my third phone, and this is one of my first installs. Simple interface, does what I want and very little else.
57a08c6a5623ed0942ed8075;Pretty goood
57a08c6a5623ed0942ed8076;Simple design Does the job -no ads!

57a08c6b5623ed0942ed8079;Its good No bs app. Does what you need.
57a08c6b5623ed0942ed807a;Does not work Doesn't work. Won't search, end of story. Bye.
57a08c6b5623ed0942ed807b;Great App! Best podcast app on Android!
57a08c6b5623ed0942ed807c;Glad it doesn't require every permission under the sun
57a08c6c5623ed0942ed807d;Simple and reliable
57a08c6c5623ed0942ed807e;Everything you need Awesome App. Much better than the commercial ones.
57a08c6c5623ed0942ed807f;First and last Podcast app!
57a08c6c5623ed0942ed8080;Title

57a08c6e5623ed0942ed8082;Complete podcast app and easy to use Great podcast app, free and ad-free. Probably the best. Loving it.
57a08c6e5623ed0942ed8083;Downloads are not persistent. It's a free app, though and it looks awesome, so it get's 4 stars. I know there's a lot of work in it.
57a08c6e5623ed0942ed8084;Very satisfied Great free podcast app!
57a08c6e5623ed0942ed8085;Simple and clean The interface is pretty clean and straightforward. Loving it.
57a08c6e5623ed0942ed8086;Easy listening Makes finding, subscribing to, and listening to podcasts easy. Works flawlessly on Moto G 3rd gen.
57a08c6e5623ed0942ed8087;Restart playback when Bluetooth reconnects is a killer feature!
57a08c6e5623ed0942ed8088;Best I love it. Simple, clean, and best of all doesn't eat up my data!

57a08c705623ed0942ed808e;Very good podcasts player Does its job well enough for me and is also free and open source software.
57a08c705623ed0942ed808f;To the point No-nosense
57a08c705623ed0942ed8090;Awesome!!! This is the very best podcast app I have ever been able to find on the Google app store. It doesn't drop the podcast randomly...very ready to use.
57a08c725623ed0942ed8091;Freaking amazing You should use this app. I've been using Antenna for a few years now and continue to grow my appreciation for it every update -- heck every *day*. I paid for a few podcast apps before getting turned onto Antenna so I feel especially qualified to proclaim that this is the best podcasting app that bandwidth can get. It's free, updated surprisingly often, and feature robust. It works excellently and has continued to improve since I began using it.
57a08c725623ed0942ed8092;No ads. Open source. It works. Nothing to complain about.
57a08c755623ed0942ed8093;Easy to use Easy to use for upload new podcasts from iTunes or Android. Clean interface.
57a08c755623ed0942ed8094;Best podcast app and I've tried many but this one wins for ease of use and not taking up so much storage plus it looks very nice.. Thank you makers xoxoxo #truecrime
57a08c755623ed0942ed8095;Everything I needed in a podcast app, and nothing more Intuitive and reliable. Also the only app I tried so far that showed newlines in descriptions.
57a08c755623ed0942ed8096;Great UX, love this app !
57a08c765623ed0942ed8097;BEST opensourced podcatcher for FOAMed Previous issue is closed: attempt to download episode or update feed faced unknown error. However, stream play can function properly. Things would only go wrong while SD card being mounted. ‚Üí it's a problem caused by SD card.
57a08c765623ed0942ed8098;Brilliant I love this and its easily the best podcast app I have tried.
57a08c765623ed0942ed8099;Best podcatcher around. It just works.
57a08c785623ed0942ed809a;Boom. In a good way. :)
57a08c785623ed0942ed809b;Great catcher Tried many over the years, this has been the only one that stuck. Been using over 2 years and they haven't broken it with updates as so often happens. Great, would recommend
57a08c785623ed0942ed809c;Great UX, Plenty of Features, Open Source! This app made me fall in love with podcasts again. The thought of not needing iTunes (which is slow, bloated, and generally awful) or the Soundcloud app (which requires subscription for offline listening) delights me.
57a08c785623ed0942ed809d;Very good podcast app Simple and works
57a08c7b5623ed0942ed809e;Decent; could be better It works great and is an amazing app, I'd personally just like it to be sorted by podcasts you could listen to offline rather than dumping them into one "downloads completed" area
57a08c7b5623ed0942ed809f;Was amazing now crashes Was a great app but recently has stopped responding quite often. Hope they fix this soon
57a08c7b5623ed0942ed80a0;Good app Needs a better way to view and delete downloads
57a08c7d5623ed0942ed80a1;OK so far I use podcast apps to play items in a queue. This does it fairly well but has occasionally stopped inexplicably in the middle of a list. Haven't fathomed why yet.
57a08c7d5623ed0942ed80a2;Great features, free, no ads, open source, reasonable permission requirements, runs stable.
57a08c7d5623ed0942ed80a3;open source and works I prefer OSS and this podcast app works great.
57a08c7d5623ed0942ed80a4;Good app
57a08c7f5623ed0942ed80a5;Literally the best player This podcast player easily beats out all the paid and free players I've ever used (including the venerable pocket cast), and it's open source to boot! Nice job.
57a08c7f5623ed0942ed80a6;Best of the bunch!!!
57a08c7f5623ed0942ed80a7;So far my favorite podcast app!
57a08c7f5623ed0942ed80a8;Great podcast app
57a08c7f5623ed0942ed80a9;Excellent
57a08c805623ed0942ed80aa;Favorite podcast app Easy to subscribe to feeds on iTunes and gpodder, or to input RSS manually. Download and streaming both work well, and the queue has many sort features. Highly preferred to Stitcher and the Apple podcast app.
57a08c805623ed0942ed80ab;Antenna Pod Great way to download, store and find a wide range of podcasts!
57a08c805623ed0942ed80ac;Great app Many functions and its free
57a08c805623ed0942ed80ad;Best Free Podcast App
57a08c805623ed0942ed80ae;Great app!! Clean interface and easy to use. One of the best podcast apps!
57a08c835623ed0942ed80af;Wonderful app Ad free, available elsewhere, and free. Streaming is flawless, downloads are quick adding podcasts are a breeze and automatic downloads work. Only podcast app worth your time.
57a08c835623ed0942ed80b0;Perfect App Full disclosure....I am not associated with the author(s) of this app and I feel no need to give gushing reviews. That said, this is the perfect app for anybody who wants to download, manage, and mow through podcasts. I have tried at least 20 other apps and only found 1-2 others that allow me to access and listen to podcasts like this one does.
57a08c835623ed0942ed80b1;Pretty good Flexible, and does all I need it to do.
57a08c855623ed0942ed80b2;Fantastic, open source and free It's simply a great Podcatcher for power users.
57a08c855623ed0942ed80b3;Good Sometimes it freezes but that could be my phone
57a08c855623ed0942ed80b4;Don't carry an iPhone Just switched back to Android. I was going to keep the iPhone for podcast listening because podcast apps aren't really that great in Android. However, Antennapod has all the features I need to leave my iPhone behind. I use a Google Nexus 5x with Marshmallow.
57a08c855623ed0942ed80b5;Please add the option for widget to skip forward and backwards on the home screen. Also, gpodder constantly gives java sync error.
57a08c855623ed0942ed80b6;Very nice Thank you very much
57a08c855623ed0942ed80b7;High quality app! Really sleek. Has all the features I would want and nothing more.
57a08c855623ed0942ed80b8;Always used podcast app for Android. It's has all functionality you need. Doesn't ask for your money. Is simple to use and has a very clean interface compared to most.
57a08c885623ed0942ed80b9;The best pod catcher/player I've found Antenna pod has all the features I would want in a pod catcher and player and great functionality. The latest update has fixed any previous issues I had. No need to look any further, just get it.
57a08c885623ed0942ed80ba;Works That's all the there is to it. It works.
57a08c8a5623ed0942ed80bb;Good to shop around I've been addicted to podcasts for my college commute for nearly a year now, and I've tried so many different apps. This one is the best refined, gives the best experience, and allows great control and suitability to your needs. It also looks fantastic, very sleek and elegant minimal design, love it
57a08c8a5623ed0942ed80bc;Solid update!
57a08c8a5623ed0942ed80bd;Great Does what it needs to do
57a08c8b5623ed0942ed80be;It works And it has no ads. Edit: It has some problems if the Bluethoot and Power Saving are on. But those appear to be native to Samsung S7 edge
57a08c8b5623ed0942ed80bf;It's great It's the best one!
57a08c8b5623ed0942ed80c0;Good app I have not used any other podcast apps to compare this one to buy it does everything I want it to and works the way I expected.
57a08c8f5623ed0942ed80c1;Love it Tried lots of podcast apps. This is my fave. Go for it.
57a08c8f5623ed0942ed80c2;Finally - no hassle podcasts! This app works very well, and makes it easy for me to find and try new podcasts, listen to a rotation of different podcasts, optionally download episodes over wifi to avoid high data use, and track which episodes I've listened to. Doesn't lose track of what you're listening to regardless of phone calls, reboots, or long-term pauses.
57a08c8f5623ed0942ed80c3;Great app,nice UI, easy to use
57a08c8f5623ed0942ed80c4;Great app
57a08c915623ed0942ed80c5;Material Design Update! Best simple podcast app keeps getting better. If all you're looking for is an app to manage, stream, and download your podcast's this is it
57a08c915623ed0942ed80c6;Generally good, not 100% intuitive interface
57a08c915623ed0942ed80c7;Podcasting hero. A very convinient app for listening of podcasts.
57a08c915623ed0942ed80c8;Best podcast software I have tried lots of different options for regular podcast use and this is easily my favourite. It is simple to use and does all the basics u need without any fuss.
57a08c925623ed0942ed80c9;Very clean, no fuss, just works
57a08c925623ed0942ed80ca;Nice clean app that works. Does what it says. Clear and nice layout.
57a08c925623ed0942ed80cb;Best Android Podcast player
57a08c925623ed0942ed80cc;Nice Lots of options, works well.
57a08c925623ed0942ed80cd;Best Tried others. This is simple.
57a08c935623ed0942ed80ce;Favorite app! This app has a few small bugs, but nothing that diminishes my enjoyment of it. Works great overall on my Note 3!
57a08c935623ed0942ed80cf;Works a treat Can't fault the app. Let's me download and listen to my podcasts without any issues.
57a08c935623ed0942ed80d0;Works great No complaints. Thank you for making it free with no ads!
57a08c935623ed0942ed80d1;Chromecast support works like a charme
57a08c965623ed0942ed80d2;Best in test! Love the app, been using it for years now. Question, the 30 skip used to be available on earbud remotes. Is it still possible?
57a08c965623ed0942ed80d3;It works This app works well and has enough features to be convenient, but not too many to be cumbersome.
57a08c965623ed0942ed80d4;Really good podcast app I haven't tried many more, but that's because once I found this one, I stopped looking. It hasn't changed my life or gotten me in shape but it does everything you'd expect and it's quite configurable. It did ask me to rate it, but only after a long while of using it, so it convinced me.
57a08c965623ed0942ed80d5;Awesome Does the job
57a08c985623ed0942ed80d6;Simply (literally) the best! With the latest update this player leaves all the others in the dust. Paid and unpaid. No esoteric resource hungry featured. Incredibly stable. Good looking working perfectly for a podcast addict like me. This is my most used app. It's playing 6-12 hours a day! It never ever fails and with the Sonic player built in it sounds great even through my high end ear buds. I really want to pay for this app! For me it's worth double digit dollars Try it. Love it and move on. This is THE player right now!
57a08c985623ed0942ed80d7;Cool clean app! I like the simplicity
57a08c985623ed0942ed80d8;Lightweight and Functional Works like a charm, very lightweight, it is exactly what I was looking for
57a08c9a5623ed0942ed80d9;Streamlined, all the things you need, perfect.
57a08c9a5623ed0942ed80da;Brilliant podcast client Everything you need, subscribe to RSS feeds, clean layout and just works.
57a08c9a5623ed0942ed80db;Works really great. Has a good usability and is completely free and without adds! Keep up the great work! Thanks a lot! 100% satisfied! I now found the "missing feature" to control my download individually for a feed: The small (i)-Menu on the feed title!
57a08ca95623ed0942ed80dc;Where's the play button? Why this platform became so lame? It used to be pure awesomeness, please let it since back again!
57a08ca95623ed0942ed80dd;Scrobble doesnt work
57a08ca95623ed0942ed80de;Do not scrobble! Only one of 10 songs is properly recognized.
57a08cae5623ed0942ed80df;The only one that actually scrobbles all my songs when listening to them. I tried the Simple Last.FM Scrobbler and worked flawlessly with my LG Optimus Fuel, until I upgraded to a ZTE Citrine, the default player would not scrobble any song with any of the apps on here, not even this one. Now I am using custom music player from CM called Eleven and it works nicely with this app. Can't get the darn Simple Last.FM app to work with any music player on the Citrine phone at all. There is one issue I have and that I do not care for apps with ads and this has one annoying ad on top with CBS when you are on wifi or any connection. If those were removed, then this would be a 5 star app.
57a08cae5623ed0942ed80e0;Bad! Scrobbles only first song correctly, to scrobb next song need to be opened. Fix it please.
57a08cb05623ed0942ed80e1;Doesn't open.
57a08cb05623ed0942ed80e2;Doesn't handle with it's main function properly Scrobbles only half of the songs and has other bugs
57a08cb05623ed0942ed80e3;Wrong tabs info Last 3 months shows overal info in top artists/albums/tracks tabs
57a08cb05623ed0942ed80e4;2 months,the app don't realize scrobblings in my profile. Rocket player premium.
57a08cb05623ed0942ed80e5;Doesn't scrobble while offline and upload when connected later like it's supposed to.
57a08cb15623ed0942ed80e6;Love it I use it everyday already at 100k scrobbles been a happy last.fm user since 2008 great music cloud service
57a08cb15623ed0942ed80e7;Almost there Few more tweaks will make this app perfect. Crashes randomly but not as often as previous builds.
57a08cb15623ed0942ed80e8;It won't even open.
57a08cb15623ed0942ed80e9;Pandora Doesn't support Pandora radio
57a08cb15623ed0942ed80ea;Please add Apple Music support! It doesn't scrobble my tracks when playing on Apple Music. üò≠
57a08cb55623ed0942ed80eb;No search feature on the app!!
57a08cb55623ed0942ed80ec;Melhorem Faz Scrobbles de alguns artistas e outros n√£o üò≠
57a08cb55623ed0942ed80ed;Mediocre app with a horrible UI. Won't work with apple music.
57a08cb55623ed0942ed80ee;Please add support for Apple music
57a08cb55623ed0942ed80ef;Stop scrobbling when interrupted When the music that was scrobbling was interrupted by notifications (from Apps or phone charging), phone calls etc. and after I paused it, it will stop scrobbling and will not record it unless I restart the song again.
57a08cb65623ed0942ed80f0;Scrobbles every song I don't like that. Even setting the scrobble point to 80% it still scrobbles a song as soon as starting. Uninstalling!
57a08cb65623ed0942ed80f1;My lastfm hasn't worked for the past month? It hasn't scrobbled any music I've listened to and I've been using the regular android music app.
57a08cb65623ed0942ed80f2;Fuxking hate it
57a08cb65623ed0942ed80f3;Would be fantastic if I could listen to tracks from the app.
57a08cb85623ed0942ed80f4;Does not scrobble This worthless garbage tells you it does scroblle your music and even shows notification with artist and song name, but I just re-checked and everything is missing. Lost my record for several months. Thanks a lot.
57a08cb85623ed0942ed80f5;Uninstall quick Worst app
57a08cb85623ed0942ed80f6;Doesn't work on dbpoweramp anymore it scrobbled just fine until a while ago. Please fix this
57a08cb85623ed0942ed80f7;Please include support for Amazon Music scrobbling. Other than that, good app.
57a08cb95623ed0942ed80f8;Doesn't scrobble Won't scrobble my plays on mediamonkey or the xperia music player. Remember, if it doesn't scrobble it doesn't count. Rubbish
57a08cb95623ed0942ed80f9;Where is the events. I only used this app to keep track of which concerts i was thinking about going to. Now this app is worthless to me. **One year later and still crap. Uninstalling. I could care less about song counting.
57a08cb95623ed0942ed80fa;Mostly useless Has major issues with FLAC files, and scrobbles only about 50% of overall listens. Why not just integrate a player into the application like in the ios version?
57a08cb95623ed0942ed80fb;Can't scrobble from sony stock music app
57a08cbc5623ed0942ed80fc;I couldn't beat the sign up page After rejecting 3 usernames (go back and start again) it rejects all password combinations including valid ones according to the rules (go back and start again) the recapture images are so small only a bot could pass them...(go back and start again) . if i can't get into the app I'm not going to use it.... Giving up
57a08cbc5623ed0942ed80fd;Nice......
57a08cbc5623ed0942ed80fe;Absolute garbage
57a08cbc5623ed0942ed80ff;Doesn't scrobble all of my Google Play tracks.
57a08cbf5623ed0942ed8100;Can you PLEASE move 'LastFm' folder out of root folder? ...and then I give you 5 stars.
57a08cbf5623ed0942ed8101;Disappointing Cannot recognized some music player app. No update again
57a08cbf5623ed0942ed8102;i seriously hate how the app is showing scrobbles all wrong. instead of 3 months, it shows overall. it happens also with album/track scrobbles, might show correct and might show overall scrobbles for 7 days (happens with other time frame also)... ah, it seriously is such a shame.
57a08cbf5623ed0942ed8103;make it multiDPI please
57a08cc15623ed0942ed8104;please let me disable now scrobbling notification
57a08cc15623ed0942ed8105;It used to work perfect but now it doesn't scrobble anything from the blackplayer app whether it's on wifi or not, google music player works fine fot whatever reason.
57a08cc15623ed0942ed8106;Notification never goes away. I like the app but the notification icon never goes away. It's stuck there even if there's no music playing. Not cool.
57a08cc15623ed0942ed8107;Doesn't really work with all players Needs more updates to work with all music player
57a08cc35623ed0942ed8108;Meh Why wouldn't they allow hiding that stupid notification it always has up? "Now Scrobbling..." I don't care!
57a08cc35623ed0942ed8109;Ruim Nao atualizam o mesmo faz muito tempo, cheio de bugs e layout defasado
57a08cc35623ed0942ed810a;Couldn't scrobble But this app let me scrobble again for the first time in weeks
57a08cc35623ed0942ed810b;Can't get it to scrobble anything And I've tried. It just sucks.
57a08cc35623ed0942ed810c;Does work any more It's just scrobbling the same track, some track I've never heard of and never played! Trying reinstalling and all.
57a08cca5623ed0942ed810d;An update to scrobble from YouTube and iHeartRadio would be pretty cool
57a08cca5623ed0942ed810e;Many of my played tracks won't scrobbled :/
57a08cca5623ed0942ed810f;Technical errors and bugs running rampant Works fine maybe half the time. I'd suggest making it a more fleshed out app so i can look at my profile, maybe my friends profiles, or at least band and artists profiles without having to go to the browser but if you couldnt even get the simple version right I tremble at the thought of what would happen if you tried doing anything so complicated as that.
57a08cca5623ed0942ed8110;Last. Fm This app barely scrobbles while on bluetooth. Please fix this bug since bluetooth is what I mainly use nowadays
57a08ccd5623ed0942ed8111;This app recognises, unlike most of its peers, Google Play Music in its current version as a media player for scrobbling. Apart from that, it's mostly worthless: It scrobbles around every fifth track at best. Most in-app links (to artist, songs, etc.) redirect to the web page anyway. Apart from the media player selection (which has switches for two different players plus one for all Other Music Players), there's only two settings, both for scrobbling.
57a08ccd5623ed0942ed8112;Not bad but not great I love that you can see the artists you have listened to and that you can view the artist information online. But my artists for 3 months is the same as my overall artists which isn't right and that's annoying. Did that I you'll get a higher rating
57a08ccd5623ed0942ed8113;Still broken App hasn't worked since they "upgraded" both the website and scrobbling to broken last year.
57a08cd05623ed0942ed8114;getting there scrobbling is patchy and a lot of stuff still links to the site but it's coming along.
57a08cd05623ed0942ed8115;It's just an broker company to apples store
57a08cd05623ed0942ed8116;Keeps scribbling the same song. It gets stuck on a song, and keeps scrobbling it every few hours. I'll open it up, and see that it's scrobbled one sing 5 times, when I haven't even listened to anything during that time.
57a08cd05623ed0942ed8117;Good app but like It scrobbles everything twice and it really annoys me. Also, I feel like the app should have to power to look at recommendations, not just what you've listened to
57a08cd15623ed0942ed8118;No new version? Oh man, let's make some changes :))
57a08cd15623ed0942ed8119;Can't open, always crashes I've tried re installing it multiple times. Every time I open it it crashes.
57a08cd15623ed0942ed811a;AMO!!! me sigam amore, buterassada.
57a08cd35623ed0942ed811b;Minimal, Lazy Effort Really, all it does is scrobble. You can't even hit the love button on a recent track unless it was recorded by the app itself. It really serves no purpose for me as a lot of music players will scrobble on their own. And it doesn't even do that well either - there are toggles to disable for certain players (e.g. Spotify), disabling does nothing and you end up with double scribbles anyway. Frustrating. Will be installing a third party app instead...
57a08cd35623ed0942ed811c;Sign-in fail Will not recognize password & user name.
57a08cd75623ed0942ed811d;Terrible app The app is horrendous, it regularly scrobbles tracks despite me not having played anything - today it's told the world I've played the same track seven times despite me not having played it once! The charts are also wrong, the three and six monthly charts show my all time usage.
57a08cd75623ed0942ed811e;Crashes every time I start it I don't know what happened. When I first installed it, it worked great. Now however it crashes on every start even though it scrobbles all my plays. I tried uninstalling, restarting the phone+cleaning out remnants and then reinstalling and it still crashes. Please fix this, it used to be such a great app. Using Samsung Galaxy S5 Active
57a08cd75623ed0942ed811f;Needs Improvement How about, adding a player to your scrobbler app like on iPhone, GOOGLE PLAY MUSIC SUCKS, or make it compatible with Amazon music
57a08cd85623ed0942ed8120;Sometimes Android scrobbling seems to break with updates to Google Play Music, but it's usually fixed pretty quickly
57a08cd85623ed0942ed8121;When I play one track more than once it doesn't work
57a08cd85623ed0942ed8122;Used to work perfectly, now won't change the current scrobbling track unless the screen is on. Using Play Music on S6 Edge+ running marshmallow
57a08cd85623ed0942ed8123;Still forcing error and closing by itself
57a08cd85623ed0942ed8124;Flawless Works perfectly on my OPO.
57a08cdb5623ed0942ed8125;Won't work on Marshmallow? Went from a Nexus 5 to a 6P and hasn't worked since I upgraded phone and OS. Logs me in fine but won't scrobble from Spotify on my phone.
57a08cdb5623ed0942ed8126;Says it scrobbles from Deezer, but doesn't. No search function.
57a08cdb5623ed0942ed8127;It scrobbles only the first song played. What is the point, then? Actually, this behavior occurs whenever a bluetooth speaker is used - only the first song is scrobbled. If the music is played on the phone itself or with headphones, no problem. Unfortunately, I use bluetooth speakers A LOT - by my bed, in the car, on my bike. For the record, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone, android 6 (Marshmallow), scrobbling from Google Music app.
57a08ce05623ed0942ed8128;Extremely disappointed 1) It's not scrobbling properly (I'm listening to one song and it scrobbles another song) 2) Keeps logging out automatically.
57a08ce05623ed0942ed8129;Can't register My password conforms to the guidelines but I keep getting told it does not. I am unable to register a new account.
57a08ce05623ed0942ed812a;It's good but... Add Friends option.Not scrobbling with jet audio.
57a08ce05623ed0942ed812b;Nicer looking interface than the simple scrobbler, but still has the same problems when I try to scrobble from Google Play Music on my Galaxy S6 - if the screen goes off it doesn't seem to scrobble a track. What use is a scrobbler if the now playing on the website doesn't get saved?
57a08ce45623ed0942ed812c;Error in last 3 months scrobbles The last 3 months show the same counts as the overall scrobbles.
57a08ce45623ed0942ed812d;Good, now stay Don't try doing anything more with the app, it works fine and I have a high suspicion something'll break... again.
57a08ce45623ed0942ed812e;App scrobbles, bit force closes when opening app I can still scrobble tracks, but when I try to open the app directly, it force closes immediately. Please fix.
57a08ce45623ed0942ed812f;Broke, won't shut down.
57a08ce45623ed0942ed8130;App keeps Crashing
57a08ce85623ed0942ed8131;Won't scrobble It doesn't scrobble automatically, i have to open it every time i want it to scrobble tracks.
57a08ce85623ed0942ed8132;Broken app Have reset my password multiple times and still can't access my account.
57a08ce85623ed0942ed8133;The app does what it says. Works fine for me, nothing broken on OPO here.
57a08ce85623ed0942ed8134;It still does what it's supposed to, but barely. Highly unstable, the app doesn't scrobble when you play a song on repeat (it will only scrobble the first time you played the song), and sometimes it doesn't save your scrobbles while you're offline. Feels almost like an abandoned app.
57a08ce95623ed0942ed8135;Not scrobbling " oh... so... it means that the only reason for you listen to music is to show on your last fm" -hmm, i thought that was the idea
57a08ce95623ed0942ed8136;Just needs bandcamp support
57a08ce95623ed0942ed8137;Nice work App
57a08ce95623ed0942ed8138;Cant login
57a08ce95623ed0942ed8139;nothing other than YouTube.. this particular app loads every track from YouTube.. worst experience I ever had.

57a08ceb5623ed0942ed813b;Works with standard Android player.
57a08ceb5623ed0942ed813c;Almost There! The app has seen some great improvements in the past 6 months and is getting quite good! This will be a 5 star app when they add scrobble support for Youtube and Youtube Music, a major source in the present age.

57a08ced5623ed0942ed813e;Highly unstable Very unreliable. Crashes randomly, scrobbles only parts of the music I listen to or scrobbles tracks twice. There is a lot of work to be done...
57a08ced5623ed0942ed813f;What the hell is this! First off this is very very confusing for a music service. Maybe I don't know how to use this not what is the purpose of this service. Nevertheless this app crashes like crazy.
57a08ced5623ed0942ed8140;Works again Seems to be working fine again, but desperately needs Apple Music support.
57a08ced5623ed0942ed8141;Lm a o Lmaaooo
57a08cef5623ed0942ed8142;What's happening? It's been a couple of months I can not even open it. Before it worked perfectly! Wake up, fix it!!
57a08cef5623ed0942ed8143;Offline scrobbling is heaven-sent I absolutely love what has been done with the app. It's so responsive to when you start playing music and doesn't often get stuck on a song. Great with Spotify.
57a08cef5623ed0942ed8144;Doesn't scrobble Hasn't scrobbled anything in weeks even though the icon shows at the top

57a08cf15623ed0942ed8149;No probs with scrobbles.. But why dafuq does it keep adding pictures of artists and album covers to my photo library?
57a08cf15623ed0942ed814a;Didn't work Wouldn't play anything
57a08cf25623ed0942ed814b;Won't even open This app has always had issues but now it's mediocrity has reached the point of not even being able of opening properly. Very consternated!
57a08cf25623ed0942ed814c;After the farce with the Last FM website this app frequently logs me out at random so I lose scrobbles.

57a08cf85623ed0942ed8154;Eh It doesn't lag your phone or drain your battery but it misses a song every ten minutes or so. I'm really particular with things like scrobbling so I'm going to have to rate it a 2/5.
57a08cf85623ed0942ed8155;Not able to run on Sony z3v
57a08cf85623ed0942ed8156;Please, add Apple Music support!
57a08cf85623ed0942ed8157;Worked well. This app worked well until about 4 days ago and then it it started to close before the app opened and now it just asks to send a report. Until it's looked at I am unable to use it at all.

57a08d0b5623ed0942ed8175;Broken... Used to work fine, then a while back, just stopped. Even the iOS app is a joke.
57a08d0b5623ed0942ed8176;Why, from bad to worse! Fix the Android login problem.
57a08d0f5623ed0942ed8177;Can't log in. Useless!
57a08d0f5623ed0942ed8178;Doesn't scrobble everything. Doesn't scrobble everything. I don't really care about the aesthetics of the app because I just got it for scrobbling purposes.

57a08d145623ed0942ed8184;Not working. It's seems to just randomly decide which songs I've actually listened to. So only about half an album gets added. Any fix for this in the works?

57a08d145623ed0942ed8188;It keeps crashing I can't even open the app, it just crashes instantly
57a08d175623ed0942ed8189;YouTube music support?
57a08d175623ed0942ed818a;Used to be good. Now it doesn't scrooble anymore, and crashes at the initialization of the app.
57a08d175623ed0942ed818b;Depends Was working ok except for double and sometimes quadruple scribbles. Now it keeps crashing.
57a08d175623ed0942ed818c;Crashing but Scrobbling The app was working well until now as it now crashes every time I try to open it. It still scrobbles in the background when my music is playing but I do wish to access the app as well.
57a08d1a5623ed0942ed818d;STOPPED WORKING TODAY I TRIED TO OPEN THE APP AND IT CLOSES EVERY TIME AND A MESSAGE IS SHOWN: THE APP STOPPED I MEAN,.. WTF IS HAPPENING?
57a08d1a5623ed0942ed818e;Scrobbling is broken Strange stuff happening when I'm playing music in AIMP: it detects every track in application but somehow the scrobble history is not recorded. Looks like app doesn't detect when the scrobbling point is reached.
57a08d1a5623ed0942ed818f;Won't Play Music There is no option to scrobble. It's just links to website.
57a08d1f5623ed0942ed8190;I last installed this 2 years ago. It didn't scrobble. 2 years later I have a new phone and jet audio. Once again. It doesn't scrobble...It looks prettier though, back to the simple scrobbler.
57a08d1f5623ed0942ed8191;Fuuu
57a08d1f5623ed0942ed8192;I'm disappointed!!! :/ When I visualize my profile on the browser, it shows me that I've listened to an artist 45 times, but when I access the app to see the same artist, there are only 35 scrobbles... it's making me sick! I've listened to a band, scrobbling more than 25 tracks according to the Lastfm website, but the information displayed on the app is quite different... please, fix that... or I won't think twice before uninstalling it...
57a08d225623ed0942ed8193;Can't scrobble For the vlc player it only scrobble the first song then it doesn't scrobble anymore until I pause and play the song
57a08d225623ed0942ed8194;Scrobble always fail Doesn't scrobble track from Deezer. Lastfm show what scrobbling in process but tracks doesn't add to my profile(

57a08d255623ed0942ed819a;It's no longer working. It doesn't scrobble.
57a08d255623ed0942ed819b;What the hell Used to work, just randomly stopped automatically opening when I open music app. It literally has one job and it can't even do it.
57a08d285623ed0942ed819c;Crap on Android, decides it dosnt always want to scrobble each track. Agitates my autism. How are people supposed to know how cool and edgy I am if it's not gona scrob each underground masterpiece I play? Butt beads
57a08d285623ed0942ed819d;What the hell? Scrobbling is so damn inconsistent, regardless of the connection type, that it might as well not exist at all. Would you mind fixing that please?
57a08d285623ed0942ed819e;Skeptical Hummm, been a few years since I've had this app. I was going to download today but looks like all the reviews say it sucks.... won't be downloading.
57a08d2a5623ed0942ed819f;Album covers Can you please score Album covers in a hidden folder? ".folder"? I'm tired of all these album covers spamming my camera roll... come on, you guys have been around for a while. Fix this.
57a08d2a5623ed0942ed81a0;Not sure why Not sure what everyone is crying about, the app works fine. It literally works just fine.
57a08d2a5623ed0942ed81a1;Omg I was so happy to see last Fm back what did they do its ruined bring back the old version
57a08d2a5623ed0942ed81a2;Doesn't work! Constantly signs me and makes me change my password, only scrobbles a few songs then gives up. Useless app.
57a08d2e5623ed0942ed81a3;Lack of support Add support for Apple Music!
57a08d315623ed0942ed81a4;I can't scrobble the tracks and the app closes

57a08d335623ed0942ed81a9;Needs the app to be open to scrobble please change it back
57a08d335623ed0942ed81aa;Simply doesn't work anymore with any music player I try despite clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling. This used to be a good app.

57a08d335623ed0942ed81ac;Hated it I wanted to create an account but it wont let me do it!!! Fix this bug!
57a08d335623ed0942ed81ad;Stopped scribbling 4-5 months ago And it still doesn't scrobble.
57a08d3a5623ed0942ed81ae;Keeps crashing
57a08d3a5623ed0942ed81af;Doesn't function as desired on my device The old streaming radio functions are long gone and the one function it has-scrobbling- doesn't function most of the time, even when I remember to manually open the LastFM app prior to starting my music, rather than relying on auto detect. Also, if you don't close out the LastFM app properly, if you close your music player first, frequently LastFM gets stuck in the notification tray.
57a08d3a5623ed0942ed81b0;:/ Ha? What kinda app is this? Very poor in design and features...
57a08d3f5623ed0942ed81b1;Lacking Lacking in a lot of features the desktop site has, and the 3 Month scrobbling records doesn't work; the 3 Month tab shows "All Time" scrobbling.
57a08d3f5623ed0942ed81b2;Just no
57a08d3f5623ed0942ed81b3;Doesn't scrobble anymore...
57a08d3f5623ed0942ed81b4;New redesign, finally, but loss of features and introduction of broken ones! However I feel like many of the features of the old app have been redirected to the website, and I don't really like the tiles redesign, give us the option for lists too. Scrobble notification now not in idle section of notifications either. Please let us change this. Update- top artists section displays the wrong artists and wrong amount of scrobbles! SORTITOUT
57a08d425623ed0942ed81b5;Used to be able to listen to radio stations. Not sure what this app does now...
57a08d425623ed0942ed81b6;Not all songs are scrobbled I listened on my phone several songs from an artist but only 6 or 7 of them got scrobbled when i listened to over 12 songs. I'm gonna use simple last fm from now on, at least until they fix this mess
57a08d425623ed0942ed81b7;It's broken It won't let me log in no matter how many times I try to do so
57a08d425623ed0942ed81b8;Useles This radio is useless as a brick to make calls
57a08d425623ed0942ed81b9;doesn't scrobble doesn't scrobble my music
57a08d465623ed0942ed81ba;Underdeveloped Thought it would have much of the same functionality as the website - last fm radio, see charts, friends etc, but it's only good for scrobbling and Spotify does that anyway.
57a08d465623ed0942ed81bb;Annoying App won't shut down once it's been started unless you restart you're phone, and it's pretty much useless. Deleted, and will disable service from all programs.
57a08d465623ed0942ed81bc;Used to work years ago, broken and useless now Scrobbler hasnt worked for me across 2 different phones and multiple android OS updates. Use simple last fm scrobbler if you want to track your music anymore.
57a08d485623ed0942ed81bd;Can't even login. More shoddy work from the last fm team. Do you make anything that works anymore?
57a08d485623ed0942ed81be;Bad request Can't login, keep getting a bad request
57a08d485623ed0942ed81bf;First app I install in all my devices Much needed UI improvement. Please make website and app consistent. Or a material design app would do.
57a08d4e5623ed0942ed81c0;No Scrobbling anymore! It used to scrobble in background whenever I played a track via any music player such as Jet Audio or Google's Play Music; but it is days it won't scrobble anything until I run the scrobbler and then play the music again in whatever player I'd been playing with. Even so, if I pause the music while the device is locked and resume again, scrobbler loses track of it and stops scrobbling. Although I haven't changed any settings regarding the app, I've cleaned data/reinstalled the app but nothing has changed.
57a08d4e5623ed0942ed81c1;What a mess Everything is mixed up
57a08d4e5623ed0942ed81c2;Not scrobbling Hasn't worked since the new website quite a few months ago.
57a08d525623ed0942ed81c3;Outdated! App last updated Nov 26, 2013. They obviously see the mobile space as a joke. This app desperately needs to be reworked from the ground up. It's sluggish, the design is dating back to Gingerbread (5 Android iterations ago) and has not seen new features or developer support in years. It's really disappointing that a great service has been hindered by such an awful app.
57a08d525623ed0942ed81c4;Beware all ye who download here It's covered in ads, it has slow load times, and it has ridiculous terminology that it insists on using. ("Scrobbles"? Really?) The only perk of this app--and the only reason I'm going to continue to use it--is that it takes up much less space on my phone than Spotify, Earbits, or Pandora do. If space is not a concern for you, turn back now.
57a08d555623ed0942ed81c5;Pretty Weak Effort This app does scrobble, so that gets it 2 stars, but once my music is scrobbled, the whole point is to be able to explore new music based on my interests. This app (and in fact last fm beta up to now) is very much lacking. The last fm official Android app has always been Spartan in capability. I just assumed that with the beta push, the app would be reimagined and improved. Nope.
57a08d555623ed0942ed81c6;Doesn't scrobble anymore Not scobbling with Google play music, it used to.
57a08d555623ed0942ed81c7;Gay Gay
57a08d555623ed0942ed81c8;Algorithm is crap. Losing scrobbles seemingly randomly. Good job.
57a08d5a5623ed0942ed81c9;Some problems... It's like the app has a mood. Sometimes is scrobles, other it just refuses to. You can never tell if it will scroble or not. Seriously, you could do a game like "Will It Scroble?" or gamble on it and make it a TV show. C'mon guys, I known you can make it work properly. Also, the concert agenda was pretty cool and we want it back...
57a08d5a5623ed0942ed81ca;Support Add support for JOOX Music please
57a08d5a5623ed0942ed81cb;Worthless Can't even login or check my music

57a08d645623ed0942ed81d5;What's going on whit the scrobbling U don't know what's happening with the scrobbling, does not work with power amp, but with Google play music or whatever the name is the scrobbling works goods, included Spotify but in Poweramp doesn't work
57a08d645623ed0942ed81d6;This app is a joke Ugly ads. Everything in settings opens up a window in my phone's browser, which would be bad enough but the website is awful too. Plus there's no way to turn off the persistent notification, so now I have to have it taking up space on my notification bar. I just want it to run in the background.
57a08d645623ed0942ed81d7;Stop scrobbling after 3-4 songs New app sucks, it stops scrobbling afteri played 3 or 4 songs, andit doesnt support jetaudio anymore

57a08d665623ed0942ed81da;Needs a lotta work. If I'm not connected to the net, then some, quite a few, scrobbles don't go through. To make things worse, even when I'm connected, some stuff still just doesn't get scrobbled. There's no particular pattern or anything so I can't figure out what's wrong. Even if I use another player, same problem. Why don't you guys have a built-in music player like on iOS??? It actually caches scrobbles properly so even u're connected, everything is sent through. Please. Fix. It. | IT DOESN'T WORK WITH DEEZER!!! üòë

57a08d7b5623ed0942ed81f6;Not sure what this thing does It randomly skips to the next song. Other than that its ok, looking for something not so convoluted ui, oh and fix the erratic volume levels. (Droid) *edit* this used to play music, now I downloaded it and all it does is "scrobble" that's not even a word! Do I have to use other services to use this? OK then, I'll just use other services and uninstall this one.
57a08d7b5623ed0942ed81f7;Not working Did somebody even tested this app? Because it doesn't work at all
57a08d7e5623ed0942ed81f8;Frustrating...not user friendly...messy...confusing...very strict security access. Took me all morning to register correctly Poor
57a08d7e5623ed0942ed81f9;Guys, it seems like music from MIUI 6 standard player is not scrobbled!
57a08d7e5623ed0942ed81fa;Will update when it works When I try to hit the "Log in" button, it freezes at the loading screen. I can't scrob anything like this!
57a08d7e5623ed0942ed81fb;SMART PHONES ARN'T DESIGNED FOR DUMMIES. Are you slow or just dumb?
57a08d7e5623ed0942ed81fc;Too basic to deliver I loved good old lastfm
57a08d815623ed0942ed81fd;No Longer Working With Deezer Was once a reliable little tool, however it no longer scrobbles tracks from Deezer. The App recognises that the song is playing however, it no longer scrobbles tracks to your account. Needs fixing.
57a08d815623ed0942ed81fe;A bit buggy. This app still scrobbles using Mobile days even if WiFi only option is selected.
57a08d815623ed0942ed81ff;Works but annoying Never exits, song stops playing and just stays in the tray forever
57a08d815623ed0942ed8200;Bugs Why do people release such crap? This is not working: double scrobbles for a single plays, the "now scrobbling" gets stuck when using Spotify with Bluetooth... This is garbage.
57a08d835623ed0942ed8201;It sucks monkey balls. Now free download doesnt even have categories section. Everything in one container. I have ifficialy cured my addiction to last fm. Good bye
57a08d835623ed0942ed8202;After patch doesn't work for me
57a08d835623ed0942ed8203;Won't even let me log in A username and password that works perfectly on the website won't even let me in on the app. Uninstall.
57a08d835623ed0942ed8204;Baby I like it
57a08d835623ed0942ed8205;Works like a charm.
57a08d875623ed0942ed8206;It used to be good... Scrobbling from PowerAmp and other music players doesn't work anymore
57a08d875623ed0942ed8207;Awful update Poweramp users DO NOT install this update, it's not working, it won't scrobble at all.
57a08d875623ed0942ed8208;I think it doesn't like poweramp Something seems to happen when i play music from that app, because when i do it from play music or any other, it scrobbles just like normal, lol even soundcloud has no problem there :c
57a08d875623ed0942ed8209;Yeah... Just it.... :)
57a08d8a5623ed0942ed820a;Hmm‚Ä¶ Dosen't work scorbble on marshmallow?
57a08d8a5623ed0942ed820b;Stupid password requirements Didn't even register to try out the app - too strict password requirements :( I'd like to be able to decide my own password on my own terms.
57a08d8a5623ed0942ed820c;Expand it There's still a lot of room for improvement
57a08d8a5623ed0942ed820d;Great!!
57a08d905623ed0942ed820e;S6 Can't log in on the app for my phone or tablet for the past two weeks. No help from customer support. I guess the service is done?
57a08d905623ed0942ed820f;Good but could be better I would love the option to hide the icon and just scrobble in the background. I don't like seeing the icon pop up for every song
57a08d905623ed0942ed8210;Needs more features I wish instead of just showing the tracks which have been scrobbled it would also show recommendations for other artists and tracks right in the app itself, also please add support for more music players like the default Xiaomi music app and the Netease music app, jango, 8tracks etc
57a08d935623ed0942ed8211;Constant crash Tried to scrobble with data on and now crashes whenever no internet connection
57a08d935623ed0942ed8212;It basically just a link to the website. Needs to be an app insted of just always taking to the websitem
57a08d935623ed0942ed8213;bring back old lastfm design
57a08d935623ed0942ed8214;Walkman (Music) support Please add support for The Walkman (Music) app
57a08d935623ed0942ed8215;Scrobling Issues The app has stopped scrobbling music after the latest update.
57a08d955623ed0942ed8216;WHY THIS APP SAVES EVERY PICTURE TO MY PHONE?
57a08d955623ed0942ed8217;Garbage Tried to login and gave email and password keeps telling me im not doin it right lol. Piece of garbage just like spotify
57a08d955623ed0942ed8218;Bring back winamp support. I still use the winamp app on my phone. So I'm losing many scrobbles. 5 stars if you bring back winamp support.
57a08d955623ed0942ed8219;Great!
57a08d955623ed0942ed821a;Last FM Excellent app!!!
57a08d9b5623ed0942ed821b;The scrobbling is back! Thanks for the brilliant update.. now the apps works back on track üëç
57a08d9d5623ed0942ed821c;LastFM has stopped Finally works. Back to 5 stars it goes.
57a08d9d5623ed0942ed821d;Doesn't scrobble The title
57a08d9d5623ed0942ed821e;fix it pls poweramp. one song on repeat scrobbles only one time, no matter how many times it was played.
57a08d9d5623ed0942ed821f;Looks great! Sadly it doesn't work any more with PowerAmp. Can you fix it please? version 2.0.0.4 update: Still not scrobbling from PowerAmp.
57a08d9d5623ed0942ed8220;repeat on spotify it doesn't scrobble song multiple times when on repeat
57a08d9f5623ed0942ed8221;Great service, bad app The old app was ugly but full of functionality. I'd take the old app over the new one any day.
57a08d9f5623ed0942ed8222;Waiting for more Design is exquisite but still it's functionally too basic. Looking forward to future releases
57a08d9f5623ed0942ed8223;Doesn't scrobble Used to work with Winamp, now doesn't, which makes it entirely useless for me.
57a08d9f5623ed0942ed8224;Doesn't scrobble Won't scrobble from Google music or Android music player. Did last week.
57a08da25623ed0942ed8225;Back after a year Thank you so much for finally updating and continuing development new engine is flawless. HTC One M9 Last FM user since 05 :)
57a08da25623ed0942ed8226;Poor features. Nothing in common with the Web based platform.
57a08da25623ed0942ed8227;Still needs visual refinement Compared to using dark backgrounds the app would look a lot better with a white background instead.
57a08db35623ed0942ed8228;Great App This app is a life saver for keeping up to date with all of my shows!
57a08db35623ed0942ed8229;Does absolutely everything I need it to do
57a08db35623ed0942ed822a;Great App Simple, not riddled with ads. This app makes it simple to track your shows. Far superior to any other app I've used for this functionality.
57a08db35623ed0942ed822b;Series Guide is a great tool It is an awesome app!
57a08db45623ed0942ed822c;Love it! Been using this app for a few years now. Nothing comes close to it and it helps me keep track of all my shows in the one place!
57a08db45623ed0942ed822d;Love it Perfect for keeping on top of all my series
57a08db45623ed0942ed822e;Awesome Just the app I was looking for!
57a08db45623ed0942ed822f;Good Helps me stay on track with my tv shows
57a08db45623ed0942ed8230;Most used app!!! I use this app all the time....thanks for such an awesome app!! Keep up the good work
57a08db65623ed0942ed8231;Never had an issue. Has every show
57a08db65623ed0942ed8232;Best episode tracker
57a08db65623ed0942ed8233;Easy to use Impassible to live without
57a08db65623ed0942ed8234;Absolutely the best!
57a08db65623ed0942ed8235;I wish the integration with trakt was more seamless. I mean it doesn't sync ur watchlist automatically, u have to add the show manually in the app after adding it to ur watchlist in trakt. Also, the app doesn't always reflect changes made on trakt.
57a08db85623ed0942ed8236;Easy to navigate, detailed summaries and nice design.
57a08db85623ed0942ed8237;A new experience Has changed how I watch TV series is excellent for keeping track of an ongoing series and helps when choosing what to watch next. Generally runs smoothly. The perfect companion for Netflix binges.
57a08db85623ed0942ed8238;Perfect Just what you need
57a08db85623ed0942ed8239;Simple and easy
57a08db85623ed0942ed823a;Awesome app to keep track of all ur tv series Great app
57a08dba5623ed0942ed823b;Excellent
57a08dba5623ed0942ed823c;I love this app! Finally I have an app that can quickly organise my shows and Movies that I watch. Its seamless intergration with Trakt is awesome so it means I rarely have to tick off anything in the app, its all done automatically. There are few times where my ratings on trakt wouldn't sync but overall a great app.
57a08dba5623ed0942ed823d;No widget Don't show widget option if it's not available. Big waste of time placing widget on screen only to find out it's only in the paid version.
57a08dba5623ed0942ed823e;So convenient It perfectly helped me organize my watching habits. Now i know what i need to watch, when new seasons begin etc.
57a08dbc5623ed0942ed823f;Trackt slows down the app Marking a show as watched waits until Trackt is updated before moving on, which sometimes takes 20 seconds, slows down the responsiveness of the app greatly.
57a08dbc5623ed0942ed8240;Useful, but synchronisation with Trakt after each change is slow and sometimes unreliable.
57a08dbc5623ed0942ed8241;Sync not working Trakt.tv sync not working. Please correct
57a08dbc5623ed0942ed8242;I love this app
57a08dbc5623ed0942ed8243;Good App
57a08dbe5623ed0942ed8244;Great Best app of its kind!
57a08dbe5623ed0942ed8245;Keep me organized Very good app, helps me keep track of all my shows, and always functions. The only issue is the lack of proper backup and transfer, how you still can do it manually.
57a08dbe5623ed0942ed8246;Best app
57a08dbe5623ed0942ed8247;Perfect Easy to use.
57a08dbe5623ed0942ed8248;Great material design trakt.tv app This is a great app for managing your watch list and check ins on trakt.tv
57a08dbf5623ed0942ed8249;Best TV tracking app out there!
57a08dbf5623ed0942ed824a;TV shows Great app..... Does exactly what is supposed to do
57a08dbf5623ed0942ed824b;Amazing
57a08dbf5623ed0942ed824c;Useful and great Love it! Well designed and works well. Wish they had a iPad version.
57a08dbf5623ed0942ed824d;Great app I could find every serie or anime in this app and de aware of every nem episode
57a08dc15623ed0942ed824e;Love it Love the app, helps me track all the series I'm watching. Always up to date. I can always find a new TV series, never had any issues.
57a08dc15623ed0942ed824f;0 flows The best series app in the store!
57a08dc35623ed0942ed8250;The best app for this. Period. It is smooth, it has a great UI, offline support, is updated regularly, and everything else is pretty much perfect! I've always wanted something like this, and I found several apps but none as good as SeriesGuide. Again, wonderful app, best cents spent on my tablet.
57a08dc35623ed0942ed8251;Great app Very useful, configurable, and easy to use. Use it constantly to track the shows I watch. Unfortunately, I can't find at least one of the U.S. summer shows. Hope they get added soon.
57a08dc35623ed0942ed8252;Pretty Good App is easy to use and helpful. Does not always find shows I watch.
57a08dc55623ed0942ed8253;Trakt.tv Thank you for supporting Trakt.tv I've been looking for an app to sync and keep updating my tv shows and this is the best one.
57a08dc55623ed0942ed8254;Brilliant! Would be even better if it synced across devices.
57a08dc55623ed0942ed8255;Does everything i need.
57a08dc55623ed0942ed8256;Greatest series app ever I am using it now for a few years now and using trakt for few months and it really rocks!
57a08dc55623ed0942ed8257;Very Useful This app has helped me keep organised sooo much
57a08dc85623ed0942ed8258;Netflix extension please?
57a08dc85623ed0942ed8259;Works Well The app does exactly what I need it to. The only downside is if I add a show to the list that I want to watch in the future, and I have to change devices, as I did recently, I lost all of those show, since I had not watched any of the episodes.
57a08dc85623ed0942ed825a;Awesome. Best tv tracking app Still the best for keeping track of episodes watched
57a08dc85623ed0942ed825b;SeriesGuide I use it every day. Best tv app around
57a08dc85623ed0942ed825c;A must have for any TV fan!
57a08dcc5623ed0942ed825d;Great way to keep up with tv I love using this app to make a list of shows I watch and see when new episodes are coming out. It's very accurate, telling you the time, day, and channel a show will be appearing on. I've also learned of special episodes that I didn't know existed before using the app, like the Breaking Bad and Dexter shorts online.
57a08dcc5623ed0942ed825e;Can't live without it Absolutely love this, keeps track of my shows not just on android but since it uses trak every activity i do across multitude of devices are integrated with this.
57a08dcc5623ed0942ed825f;Very useful when you watch over 40 shows. It's easy to use and has a nice design. Connecting trakt.tv is also great
57a08dcc5623ed0942ed8260;Nice App Just what I need
57a08dcd5623ed0942ed8261;Great app Makes tracking what shows I watch and where I am in what series easy. I use it linked with trakit site
57a08dcd5623ed0942ed8262;Awesome to keep track of my series Really helpful to help you keep track of episodes and release dates. I'd recommend to anyone following multiple shows.
57a08dcd5623ed0942ed8263;UI can be more intuitive
57a08dcd5623ed0942ed8264;Brilliant Linked to trakt and kodi this is brilliant for tracking tv shows.... Lovely app.. Thank you.. Faultless.
57a08dcf5623ed0942ed8265;How do I check in on trakt now? Before I was able to easily check in when I was watching shows... Not I'm not sure how to do this anymore?
57a08dcf5623ed0942ed8266;Awesome!
57a08dcf5623ed0942ed8267;Possibly one of the best Android apps When I switched to iPhone for a year, I missed this app the most. Anybody who keeps up with currently running TV shows will love this app. I don't normally write app reviews but I had to make an exception for Series Guide. The developers have done a fantastic job. Well done!
57a08dcf5623ed0942ed8268;Very good guide
57a08dd25623ed0942ed8269;Very useful... i found most of the series in theur database... but i'm always watching seasons after all episodes are out so i would know how up to date it is on new releases
57a08dd25623ed0942ed826a;Great
57a08dd25623ed0942ed826b;The best thing I use it for 3 years and i was never disappointed with this app.the best app for keeping track of your shows
57a08dd25623ed0942ed826c;Best app in its category Developers: you get 5 stars and social media promotion from my end if you add the feature to back up the lists on cloud too. I have the paid version and this is a must have general feature.
57a08dd35623ed0942ed826d;Very good and quite useful. I use it to track all my TV shows.
57a08dd35623ed0942ed826e;A great app for TV series junkies like me. Thanks!
57a08dd35623ed0942ed826f;Amazing app Helping me so much
57a08dd35623ed0942ed8270;Awesome Is really helpfull
57a08dd35623ed0942ed8271;Great App use it all the time
57a08dd65623ed0942ed8272;Great I have had this app for a few years now, and I absolutely love all the changes and the evolution of the app. I'm really enjoying the synchronization with series cloud. I can't wait to see what comes next
57a08dd65623ed0942ed8273;Suits my needs Does everything I need it to do, from tracking series, to adding movies and series to watch lists.
57a08dd65623ed0942ed8274;Love this app. Great for keeping track of everything I'm watching
57a08dd65623ed0942ed8275;Works Great I really haven't had any issues with Series Guide as it works so well. It's great to remember where I am in series that I'm watching as well as telling me that the next episode of the shows that's Im watching are out
57a08dd75623ed0942ed8276;Excellent I'd be lost without it
57a08dd75623ed0942ed8277;Awesome Perfect for tracking tv shows and trakt integration
57a08dd95623ed0942ed8278;Will get 5 then sync across devices
57a08dd95623ed0942ed8279;Awesome. Except there is no sync between devices
57a08dd95623ed0942ed827a;Perfect app to keep track of all tv shows and movies Perfect app to keep track of all tv shows and movies, a must have
57a08dd95623ed0942ed827b;Good app Makes it easy to remember and track the series you watch
57a08ddb5623ed0942ed827c;Great tool for tracking series Have been using Series Guide for a year and found it to be a fantastic app. Ability to sync across multiple devices as standard would make it almost perfect!
57a08ddb5623ed0942ed827d;Great way of keeping track of all the tv shows
57a08ddb5623ed0942ed827e;Thumbs Down to Now Tab No operational issues but the new Now tab is a dud. I used to live on the Recent, Upcoming, and History tabs. Not anymore. The Now and Upcoming tabs show the same info for today's date. Why? Guess I'll go back to the trakt.tv website. =o(
57a08ddb5623ed0942ed827f;The best To keep track of what is watch or not on tv. Easy to use, nice display.
57a08ddd5623ed0942ed8280;Love this app! I would give it 5 stars except I feel there are two very important features missing. First, you have to be connected to the Internet to mark an episode as watched. I wish there was a way you could be offline and still check in and the next time you were online it would then sync. Second, in the movies section, I wish there was another option other than watchlist and collection. I would like to be able to check off the movie as watched. Other than that it is a terrific app!
57a08ddd5623ed0942ed8281;Amazing It makes it easy to keep track of all the series I follow, all in one app. Can't live without it anymore.
57a08ddd5623ed0942ed8282;Awesome Epic
57a08ddf5623ed0942ed8283;Perfect way to keep track of TV shows Love this app. Periodic tweaks make it better and better.
57a08ddf5623ed0942ed8284;Excellent way to track TV shows Fantastic app to track TV shows and movies and connect to kodi. I would love to see more options or categories. Separate TV shows with an own-it or wants categories, etc.
57a08ddf5623ed0942ed8285;No longer updates seasons This app used to rock, but lately it hasn't been updating. It can't find new episodes of popular shows like game of thrones, suits, sherlock. Am I doing something wrong?
57a08ddf5623ed0942ed8286;Great Excellent media tracker.
57a08de15623ed0942ed8287;Great app, great library I would love cloud sync to be free
57a08de15623ed0942ed8288;Great app! Does everything I need it to do and has a responsive dev that keeps the app up to date. Definitely recommend it!
57a08de15623ed0942ed8289;The best The best app to track series I've found!
57a08de15623ed0942ed828a;Love it! I love this app. It is perfect for my needs to track all my TV shows and what I have watched.
57a08de35623ed0942ed828b;Excelente!
57a08de35623ed0942ed828c;Good tracker Integrates well with lots of apps. Easy to use. Would give a 5th star if I had more control over the time span in "Recent" menu.
57a08de35623ed0942ed828d;Great app Easy to find and add shows. Also good that it updates when shows will/if return
57a08de35623ed0942ed828e;Great app.. Very useful.. Either to have a list of watched shows or to checkout a watched show and for every episode the brief story and reviews is quite useful!
57a08de75623ed0942ed828f;Pretty neat, except that shows aren't synchronised across devices I like SeriesGuide and I recognise it has gotten better lately, but I still miss the show sync-ing across my two devices. It sucks that when I start "following" a slow on my tablet, it doesn't get tracked by my phone. I've of course linked both to my Trackt account! Still, takes sometimes forever to set an episode to "watched", then fails...
57a08de75623ed0942ed8290;Great Bought premium just to support dev, really useful app if you watch a lot of tv series, whether they're currently airing or have ended long ago!
57a08de75623ed0942ed8291;Awesome app. Keeps me up to date on watched shows and shows that I want to watch
57a08de95623ed0942ed8292;Android N Overall a super app, but it FC's all the time in android N preview. I don't expect it to work right away, but just so you know, it's not runnable on N.
57a08de95623ed0942ed8293;Perfect Simple and easy you can keep track of episodes from your TV series. A lot of options available.best of its kind.
57a08de95623ed0942ed8294;Brilliant Work very well, easy to track upcoming episodes, seasons.
57a08de95623ed0942ed8295;Nice app to keep track of TV shows
57a08dea5623ed0942ed8296;When marking an episode as watched through trakt, seriesguide takes an excessive amount of time to sync to the new update. Air times are off by several days and forcing manual update takes longer than expected to update.
57a08dea5623ed0942ed8297;Great app Awesome app for tracking your TV consuming
57a08dea5623ed0942ed8298;Love love love it!! Thank you!
57a08dec5623ed0942ed8299;This app is great and the developer works every day to upgrade and improve it. Great job Uwe!
57a08dec5623ed0942ed829a;Favourite app Love it. Awesome and effective way to keep track of which episodes I have watched and when shows air next. Great work.
57a08dec5623ed0942ed829b;Is mostly great It's a nice client for Trakt. It could use a little better UX but it's very good anyway.
57a08def5623ed0942ed829c;Pretty good Best tv app I've come across
57a08def5623ed0942ed829d;A little confusing to use at first but good. Best combined with a trakt account but not necessary.
57a08def5623ed0942ed829e;Super useful Great app! Extremely useful, nice UI, helps keep track of the shows and syncs with Trakt... Just perfect :)
57a08def5623ed0942ed829f;I don't know what I'd do without it SeriesGuide has slowly become one of the most important apps I use. It is an invaluable tool not just for tracking my shows, but connecting to Trackt as well.
57a08df15623ed0942ed82a0;Great app Perfect for keeping track of watched shows and reminding you when they're on.
57a08df15623ed0942ed82a1;Great app Could improve navigation
57a08df15623ed0942ed82a2;Use it everyday. Got it because it works with trakt. Paid for the premium for the cloud backup. Well worth it.
57a08df15623ed0942ed82a3;Great app.
57a08df15623ed0942ed82a4;Great Does what I need it to!

57a08df45623ed0942ed82a6;Great. Great app.
57a08df45623ed0942ed82a7;Great app for tracking my series I love the integration with Trakt.tv, I can just add a new series here and scrobble it where I have my trakt.tv account. No more figuring out what's the last episode I saw!
57a08df45623ed0942ed82a8;The best
57a08df75623ed0942ed82a9;Great app for tracking box sets I'm a LoveFilm subscriber so this is really handy for tracking where I am in various box sets I might be watching. Just be aware there are potential spoilers if you view future episodes.
57a08df75623ed0942ed82aa;Series guide Using it constantly!
57a08df75623ed0942ed82ab;What episode are we on again? Let's you know which one you left off on. Also satisfying to check of episodes.
57a08df75623ed0942ed82ac;Great but Would love to buy the full version but the trakt sync never seems to work. Have to keep marking the same show as seen over and over again so just disconnect it.
57a08df95623ed0942ed82ad;Great Love it.
57a08df95623ed0942ed82ae;Great app Really useful, particularly like the funtion that tells u how many hours of tv uve watched, both intruiging and depressing!
57a08df95623ed0942ed82af;Awesome It's fantastic.
57a08df95623ed0942ed82b0;The best one

57a08dfb5623ed0942ed82b2;Disconnection I love this app..but why does the trackt account keeps on getting disconnected?

57a08dfd5623ed0942ed82b7;Great app can only get better is there a possibility of the series guide writing to a Gmail calendar. it's nice to look forward to episodes even better when you are not darting around when they have moved a week etc

57a08e005623ed0942ed82bb;Irreplaceable TV show tool As someone that watches a lot of TV from a broad range of sources this tool keeps track of everything I've watched and let's me know when new episodes will be /are released. It's integration with trakt is quite useful and it's total time watched is amusing. Highly recommended.
57a08e005623ed0942ed82bc;Nice setup Easy to see what shows are coming up and which ones you have missed. Great source of information for each show as well. Best part is they keep updating it here and there to make it even better. Thanks guys

57a08e065623ed0942ed82c6;Series Guide review Great cloud features with the integration of Trakt. Collections is very helpful. Watchlist is also useful. TMDB is good as there are many movies available for search. The app never has trouble returning results.

57a08e1a5623ed0942ed82ea;Simple and effective Well designed.
57a08e1e5623ed0942ed82eb;Serves my needs with zero complaints SeriesGuide is the only app I use for tracking my shows and for digging into characters, actors, directors and the lot. The extensions are very useful and, while it helps to have native apps installed like IMDb, they're not necessary with the ability to do quick web searches for shows and episodes. Integration with Trakt works well for me, though I've heard others moan about it. Also seems to keep me synced across multiple devices with no problems. Well done.
57a08e1e5623ed0942ed82ec;On point. I have show ADD and will bounce between shows. Series guide keeps me on track to where i left off. Love it

57a08e2b5623ed0942ed82ff;One of best TV and movie tracking app Have been using this for more than a year. It's quite helpful to keep track of series and pending episodes. I don't use the social aspect of the app so cannot comment on that. I have see d the evolution of the app and it has followed Android design guidelines since the past year. The UX has been simple and intuitive. One drawback is when you click a having seen an episode there is a lag in response.
57a08e2b5623ed0942ed8300;I love it. Best app to remain updated about my favourite TV series. Thank you for this app

57a08e3d5623ed0942ed831e;Its good. Just that. Wish we could get a different way to view the shows like for example in landscape mode instead of portrait. Having to scroll all the way down for a show is no fun. Otherwise its a good app.

57a08e435623ed0942ed8326;Pretty good It lost all my shows and I had to re add them. Still better than anything else that I've found.
57a08e435623ed0942ed8327;Used it for years! Series guide has been my go to watch list for years now. I travel frequently and being able to pull up episodes and check if I've seen them or not is one more thing I don't have to remember while on the road. It's great!

57a08e595623ed0942ed8339;AMAZING & RELIABLE APP! I have been using this app for several years now, across multiple devices, and I absolutely freakin LOVE IT! We "Cut The Cord" so to speak about 3 yrs ago to save money. Now I watch everything online w/the help of this app. It allows me to keep a library of all the shows I want to watch, shows when they will be aired, includes both series & episode summaries, allows me to create, sort & maintain lists of shows I watch, check boxes mark episodes as watched or skipped, I can rate episodes, leave or review comments. It is linked w/my Trakt aucct. as well as the cloud, is able to back up & sync w/multiple devices. It's AMAZING! Even before we cut the cord, I used this app, that way I never missed a show. If I seen a commercial for an upcoming series, I quickly add it to my library, that way 4 months from now when it starts, I won't miss it, I will know what channel, what time & date each episode is aired on, I can set reminders or just look at my list to see what's on tonight, or this week. I can even track movies keeping a list of what I want to see, what I have seen & how I rated it, as well as what I collect (or actually own) which is AWESOME! MUST HAVE APP for tv/movie lovers!
57a08e595623ed0942ed833a;Keeps me up to date!! It's the easiest way to keep up with all my shows!!

57a08e8a5623ed0942ed837c;Good, but problems of late I've been using this app for a while with great results, but lately I've been having loads of trouble with syncing with trakt. Since I only use the app to manage my trakt account from my smartphone, this has broken the app for me. However, the superiority of the interface compared with other apps that sync with trakt keeps me coming back.

They can be added to favourites so they appear at the top (very handy for the current shows you're watching). There's synopsis and a screenshot for each episode. Looks great (material design). One of my favourite apps. Got Trakt setup on Kodi with SALTS. Fantastic. All next episodes are waiting...

57a08ecf5623ed0942ed83ce;Love it! Perfect combination of simplicity and functionality. Easy to use, does what it's meant to and has no extra garbage that no one needs. You can backup the data on cloud storage like Google Drive and restore on a new phone. Also the developer cares about improving the app regularly. I simply love that app!
57a08ecf5623ed0942ed83cf;Exactly what I wanted Pick series I want to watch and manage my collections really well. Still using it 2 or 3 years later!
57a08ed25623ed0942ed83d0;Effective! As someone who watches too much television for his own good, this app helps keep me sane.

57a08ed25623ed0942ed83d2;Keeps getting better
57a08ed25623ed0942ed83d3;This app is perfect. Keeping track of my shows has become a breeze, definetely recommending this to my friends.
57a08ed55623ed0942ed83d4;Awesome very helpful apps for tv serial or anime serial lovers. I can know my last episode of some tv series that usually i dont remember because busy or too much serials :)
57a08ed55623ed0942ed83d5;Very helpful Helps me easily manage the series I watch + great UI
57a08ed55623ed0942ed83d6;Love it! I'm a person who forget sometimes which episodes I watched and which not, this app is a dream for me. üòÅ
57a08eeb5623ed0942ed83d7;Absolutely love it. I'm so in love with the idea & execution of this app. However the double tap gesture (to view the artwork in details) is slowing my screen locking speed (since my phone's default screen lock gesture is double tap). Can this be changed to a long press or something else, please? Anyway, great job!
57a08eeb5623ed0942ed83d8;Very good I wish there was a way to access my Google photos as a source without an extension.
57a08eed5623ed0942ed83d9;Good app but missing some crucial features Works well. Works very well for quicktheme feature of Action Launcher 3... But no way to set a folder individual images need to be added. Also no option of crop, fit screen for horizontal images... Minimum time for rotating the image is one hour it should start from 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour and so on. If the above mentioned features are added it will be a 5 star app. But as of now 4 star...üëç
57a08eed5623ed0942ed83da;Not working on my Redmi note 3 Unable to change wallpaper. I have to manually go-to app and force change wallpaper. Worse, The lockscreen wallpaper does not change. It remains the default provided by xiomi.
57a08ef05623ed0942ed83db;My fav, but with a flaw Although this wallpaper app is my very favorite to use, it really drains my memory usage. If it were more lightweight in terms of how much memory it uses up, I'd never stop using this wallpaper. (Galaxy S6)
57a08ef05623ed0942ed83dc;1 of my favorite app
57a08ef05623ed0942ed83dd;Missing some features We can't select a whole folder. We can't select more than one extension at a time with different update intervals between them.
57a08ef05623ed0942ed83de;OnePlus 3 Is not working, trying everything.
57a08ef45623ed0942ed83df;Brilliant! But.. App works well, thank you very much! But i have a feature request: when I have a large landscape photo and I open Muzei to read the title, and move the image left or right, would it be possible to keep the position i move it to? Sometimes the focus of the picture isn't dead centre, it'd be nice to centre it myself. :)
57a08ef45623ed0942ed83e0;No longer updates background.
57a08ef45623ed0942ed83e1;This app... This app is simply perfection. Simply. Just perfection. Esvpecisly because of the awesome add-ons. I love the developer. Amazing app. Forever will use it. Amazing, truly amazing.
57a08ef45623ed0942ed83e2;Favorite!! Been using this for a year!!! Still great!!!
57a08ef65623ed0942ed83e3;Awesome app and great extension support Check out the Reddit extension!
57a08ef65623ed0942ed83e4;The wallpaper blacked out once! Please fix.
57a08ef65623ed0942ed83e5;Lacks png functionality A black bar appears over the bottom portion of png images when they are unblurred (in their original form). This would be an amazing and useful app if not for this glitch. Most if not all of the wallpapers I would like to use are png images. I would understand if png was uncommon, but it's not.
57a08ef65623ed0942ed83e6;Massive battery drain Forced to uninstall after it cut battery life down to 4 hours per full charge. Battery could usually last a day otherwise. Everything else about the app worked fine.
57a08ef75623ed0942ed83e7;Great! Just 2 things: 1.) Ability to select a FOLDER when selecting custom pictures. 2.) Shortcut or widget to switch wallpapers. Other than that it's a fantastic app! [EDIT] Update please?!! I'll have to switch to another wallpaper app if this one isn't going anywhere. :(
57a08ef75623ed0942ed83e8;Great app for art lovers
57a08ef75623ed0942ed83e9;Crashed
57a08ef75623ed0942ed83ea;No longer works No longer working on Cyanogenmod 13.1. Real shame as its my favourite app :(
57a08ef95623ed0942ed83eb;Great when it works I've been having trouble updating pictures even when I force it to change.
57a08ef95623ed0942ed83ec;The best wallpaper app Love it. It is the first app I install on my phone and keeps pulling stunning wallpapers each time paired with 500px plugin
57a08ef95623ed0942ed83ed;Runs perfectly, no lag issues. Usually something like this would drastically slow down your phone/PC but I've had no issues with performance. My only gripe is the picture change frequency. It has many options from hours to days but I'd like to see a "Less than one hour" or custom option.
57a08efb5623ed0942ed83ee;Love it but Love my ever changing wallpapers. But can't seem to figure out how to centre the image if I've only got one home screen. I end up seeing just the left side of all my images.
57a08efb5623ed0942ed83ef;So nice Haven't changed by background app since I found this
57a08efb5623ed0942ed83f0;Best This is the best.

57a08f005623ed0942ed83f8;It's a really good app It initially did not auto-update, I found out that it was so because it was not allowed to auto-start by MiUI security permission manager now I have allowed it and it works flawlessly. I the picks by reddit extension with it.
57a08f005623ed0942ed83f9;One thing If you had the option to apply a small selection of Instagram-like filters to a all the wallpapers, that would make this perfect.
57a08f025623ed0942ed83fa;I like how everyday I can unlock my phone and see a new background. It's so refreshing and I love how high quality the images are. This is just my perfect wallpaper app.
57a08f025623ed0942ed83fb;Best Wallpaper app ever! I really love how costumizable this app is, also how ram and battery friendly it is. Thanks for this amazing app.
57a08f025623ed0942ed83fc;Muzei APP Good to see old and new art.
57a08f025623ed0942ed83fd;Sources It is a very premium app, for no cost. It does it's job well, but it would be nice if it could support multiple sources and use a random source daily. Other than that, I would heavily recommend it.
57a08f045623ed0942ed83fe;Crashed Nice application but it crash everyday and I should reset my phone!
57a08f075623ed0942ed83ff;Daily dose or art education Love it. Love getting to know a new painting everyday, as well as stumble upon old favourites.
57a08f075623ed0942ed8400;Not centered Facets as source didn't get centred when applied
57a08f075623ed0942ed8401;Update: App not functioning properly since Marshmallow update. Musei splash screen stutters at the Activate screen and does not apply the wallpaper setting. Previously: Love this app, but we seriously need multiselect for adding our own photos from the gallery.
57a08f0a5623ed0942ed8402;Nice App but still lacking Needs the ability to save artworks, if not, at least the ability to choose what artwork you want or when the intervals are for the next painting. I'm surprised that this isn't a feature yet. Disappointing...
57a08f0a5623ed0942ed8403;Portraits Overall cool app but way too many portraits. Needs better diversity.
57a08f0a5623ed0942ed8404;Fantastic wallpaper One of the best live wallpapers ever. Good job, dev.
57a08f0a5623ed0942ed8405;Wonderful! Redefines wallpaper! Simply stunning!
57a08f0c5623ed0942ed8406;how to open it and activated really I don't know so complicated
57a08f0c5623ed0942ed8407;What a great app It's a great app
57a08f0c5623ed0942ed8408;Nice
57a08f0c5623ed0942ed8409;Memory Hog I kept getting low memory notifications from my S5 and went to the applications settings to manage what was running, only to find this app using nearly 300MB. Absurd for an app that manages a static image.
57a08f0c5623ed0942ed840a;The good guys Patrick
57a08f105623ed0942ed840b;Great app but don't get why there is no info about each painting or at least a link to Wikipedia to make it easier. I'd imagine that most people installing it would want to learn more about the paintings.
57a08f105623ed0942ed840c;Its alright The app is ok I would suggest adding album covers when music is playing by default and not as an extension
57a08f105623ed0942ed840d;Nice in theory, unfortunately none of the plugins I've tried work properly, and even when it's just using local pictures it's apparently using the most battery of any app on my phone! I also wish there was a finer control on the blurring, there's quite a big step between not blurred and the smallest amount of blurring you can get.
57a08f125623ed0942ed840e;Why... ... No ability to select multiple photos at a time or a FOLDER of images . This one at a time stuff sucks.
57a08f125623ed0942ed840f;Huge data usage 14days data usage over 1.18GB
57a08f125623ed0942ed8410;Does not work on Android N.
57a08f125623ed0942ed8411;Amazing! Simply amazing, so simple and elegant, best wallpaper app i've tried so far, keep it up!
57a08f195623ed0942ed8412;It has some flaws When i switch to use Backdrop as my source, my wallpaper are always shuffle to the previous wallpaper, it's so annoying to go change it every time it happens. Please make it so that it don't switch to the previous one. Thank you
57a08f195623ed0942ed8413;I'd give 100 stars if possible I love this app, especially the Reddit plugin
57a08f195623ed0942ed8414;Great but... - Would love the option of sorting the subreddit by 'top' 'hot' and 'new' (all time, past week..etc.) (reddit extension) - Being able to blur the screen when you want (double tapping background) should also be an option as opposed to the always blury unless you tap (and even then, it stays clear for a few seconds and goes back to blur). What I suggest is having more control over the blur option.
57a08f1c5623ed0942ed8415;Needs a way to skip paintings Loved this app but had to uninstall as I didn't like a painting in particular and there is no way to skip a painting. I'm a very open minded person but there are things I just don't wanna see each time I unlock my phone.
57a08f1c5623ed0942ed8416;Bad !!! It doesnt work well , do not change the photos daily , actually it only worked at first day and i have same photo for 3 days . Some times backgroubd goes all black
57a08f1c5623ed0942ed8417;Crash I love your app but it keeps crashing and stopping. What's wrong?
57a08f1f5623ed0942ed8418;Will it ever be updated for Marshmallow and beyond? The app doze or app suspension features in Marshmallow and beyond make it such that the wallpaper will change for a few days and then stop until I fiddle with the app. Last update was November of 2015. Feels like an abandoned project, which is unfortunate because it's such a great way to keep your home and lock screens fresh and interesting.
57a08f1f5623ed0942ed8419;It's ok There is only one problem, it doesn't show the wallpaper on my lock screen
57a08f1f5623ed0942ed841a;Power-intensive 12mAh Power-intensive 12mAh
57a08f1f5623ed0942ed841b;Ok Better if it can choose between potrait or landscape orientation
57a08f215623ed0942ed841c;Yah PREVIOUS:Im so kawaii right , yeah so kawaii. Anyway, to the review. This app is very cool to use but its not paeticularly needed but i will still rate it 5stars. NOW: LOL sorry for that review anyways.
57a08f215623ed0942ed841d;Fantastic app. Option to add sources of wallpapers is a game changer.
57a08f215623ed0942ed841e;Nice app Would have given 5 stars but for the fact that it blurs too quickly, couldn't there be an option to delay the blurring to say one minute?
57a08f215623ed0942ed841f;Great app! Beautiful wallpapers, can't ask for more
57a08f225623ed0942ed8420;Fascinating application Free open museum for your phone wallpapers
57a08f225623ed0942ed8421;Love the app but it stops updating every few days.
57a08f225623ed0942ed8422;I dont get it Needs looong time load next picture if at all. But maybe its just me.
57a08f225623ed0942ed8423;Awsome!! Used it on my Note 3, Htc m8, Note 4, galaxy s6 edge, Note 5 and galaxy s7 edge. Loved it on each phone. I recommend this to everyone..:)
57a08f225623ed0942ed8424;Brilliant Best wallpaper app there is. great work
57a08f255623ed0942ed8425;Awesome! I have to reinstall this app every once in awhile. Well worth it.
57a08f255623ed0942ed8426;Love this app butttt.... It would be great if we had an option to un blur it on the home or lock screen!
57a08f275623ed0942ed8427;Awesome This provides amazing wallpapers every hour for me and I love it! Especially with Android Wear support!
57a08f275623ed0942ed8428;Please fix on marshmallow The app cannot able to change the lock screen wall paper :'(
57a08f275623ed0942ed8429;Doesn't work This thing doesn't even work with backdrops
57a08f275623ed0942ed842a;Great app If you're remotely interested in art especially 19th and 20th century, go for it.
57a08f275623ed0942ed842b;Nice app my wallpaper changes timely. I have connected to a source.
57a08f2a5623ed0942ed842c;Cool idea but Too much blur. I'd like a slider so I can change it to however much I want. Also, it gets sooooo dark, why?
57a08f2a5623ed0942ed842d;It is a great app but it could be better if I could choose which photos folder will go random for wallpaper
57a08f2a5623ed0942ed842e;Liked it and worked very well in lollipop, but not MM The plugins don't refresh, manual navigation to next image doesn't work. Some plugins give error. Altogether seems broken after MM update on Note 4.
57a08f2a5623ed0942ed842f;Simply loved it. üòç
57a08f2d5623ed0942ed8430;So well done. I love how simple it is, but that is allows for customization, too. The ability to add new sources is super cool. Great app, Roman. Thanks!
57a08f2d5623ed0942ed8431;I love what the app does and it performs incredibly well... except when it seems to make everything else slow to a crawl. Definitely worth trying, but be aware.
57a08f2d5623ed0942ed8432;Good wallpaper I like this idea, and app in general, but after being used for a long time, this starts using up a lot of ram, and although it doesn't effect performance for me yet, I get put off from using it for that reason.
57a08f305623ed0942ed8433;Hi Roman, could you please, please, pretty please add option to only apply blur on the image while the lockscreen is on, and none when the device is unlocked? Thanks either way :)
57a08f305623ed0942ed8434;Not working since the last update The app keeps crashing every two minutes after the last update. Please fix it.
57a08f305623ed0942ed8435;Superb An app as elegant and honest as the works it displays.
57a08f305623ed0942ed8436;Doesn't freeze. Amazing interface. Well done mate
57a08f325623ed0942ed8437;What a great idea! I just love this app! It is a wonderful reminder of the beauty of art and the paintings are very appropriate for being phone backgrounds :)
57a08f325623ed0942ed8438;Why can't you shrink the image to fit screen? I am using facets. Wallpapers won't set properly, it won't shrink before applying the wallpaper. What's the point in not shrinking the wallpaper and displaying it in irrelevant positions!
57a08f325623ed0942ed8439;Just what I was looking for Beautiful, minimal app with fantastic extensive capabilities. Really want the opposite of the blur feature to be implemented though - lock screen should be blurred and the home screen should be clear.
57a08f355623ed0942ed843a;Absolutely gorgeous This is just perfect. Makes the screen look new everyday and doesn't drain battery
57a08f355623ed0942ed843b;I wish out wasn't all fuzzy I know it's to be less distracting but I wish there was a setting option to make it not blurry.
57a08f355623ed0942ed843c;Best wallpaper app Great app for art lovers. Love the blur feature so I can enjoy the nice background but still read time and battery info.
57a08f355623ed0942ed843d;Pretty cool I really like the app, is simple, intuitive, easy to use. I wish they added a widget for a quick wallpaper change. I removed 2 stars. Why? How about you let me choose a folder of images from my phone instead of having to add one by one?
57a08f375623ed0942ed843e;Center the image Please allow us to choose whether we want the wallpaper to be swipeable or just leave it there and crop it or select where to be the center of the pan. Please! Been waiting for 3 years to see if you figured that out
57a08f375623ed0942ed843f;Can't choose a wall? Use this. I love this. Cycles through all of your walls
57a08f375623ed0942ed8440;Wallpaper resonates with your day!
57a08f375623ed0942ed8441;Best app EVER!!! Thanks devs for such an awesome app. Cannot recommend it enough.
57a08f3a5623ed0942ed8442;Best app for art lovers Can u also please add indian exotic art??
57a08f3a5623ed0942ed8443;A small request I'd love for the watch face to update even if the phone background isn't set to Muzei
57a08f3a5623ed0942ed8444;Crashes I use this so as my default wallpaper app, but lately it has been crashing like crazy, and I have been reporting it every time it crashes, please fix it, I hate my static wallpaper now.
57a08f3a5623ed0942ed8445;User for 3-4 years now This wallpaper is a necessity on any of my phones/devices.
57a08f3d5623ed0942ed8446;One bug... Pls fix it When I double tap on SOME of my wallpapers from Backdrops app.... They tend to get that black strip on the bottom which appears in the preview of the wallpapers on the Muzei app.... Pls fix this asap
57a08f3d5623ed0942ed8447;Bad positioning I would've given it 5 stars but the dealbreaker is that on my nexus 6p, the wallpaper zooms in and crops itself towards the right covering 2/5 of then beautiful images.
57a08f405623ed0942ed8448;Good idea but missing some features When it works it works very good but when it doesn't it's frustrating. For some reason the wallpaper won't refresh for me when I click on the double arrows to change to a new wallpaper, there is no way of favourating images so that they would repeat in the future or downloading them. You cannot add a folder from your gallery for it to automatically rotate wallpapers from, only individual images can be added
57a08f405623ed0942ed8449;Awesome app I use it with Reddit add-on and I really enjoy the refreshing backgrounds.
57a08f405623ed0942ed844a;Amazing This app is such a great addition to my suite of customization apps. It is evident that very much attention to detail was put forth. Very High Quality app.
57a08f435623ed0942ed844b;Great app! Awesome app to show you album art on lock screen. Little tricky St first, but works perfectly! Highly recommend!
57a08f435623ed0942ed844c;Absolutely amazing app.When I apply wallpaper with muzei I also get better quality.
57a08f435623ed0942ed844d;Lags on lockscreen I almost absolutely love Muzei but its laggy on the lockscreen. Like it takes more than a second to unlock from a sleep state.. Please fix
57a08f435623ed0942ed844e;Nye app
57a08f465623ed0942ed844f;Nice but... This app always seem to crash in background every once in an while in my SGS4. I need to activate it again and again. Please fix this error.
57a08f465623ed0942ed8450;Not working on marshmallow This used to work great but since upgrading to marshmallow it won't auto cycle through new wallpapers on multiple different extensions. It's stuck until I open the app or reinstall the extensions.
57a08f465623ed0942ed8451;Very nice wallpaper app The unlock transition effect is beautiful. However I notice when I exit from a landscape app, the wallpaper seems didn't resize properly at first. Leaving the right side of the background remain black color. After a short while, it only adjust back. If that can be fixed. I'll give it 5 stars.

57a08f485623ed0942ed8453;Great app! One of the best apps I have installed. Big thanks to the developers!
57a08f485623ed0942ed8454;Data hog I'm not even currently using this app for my wallpaper yet it used over 600mb of network data in the last several hours. Good thing i was on wifi. This app is getting greenified or removed because its broken.
57a08f485623ed0942ed8455;Something's wrong. It used to be perfect but now some wallpapers randomly have their bottoms turned into black nothingness.
57a08f495623ed0942ed8456;Unstable Doesn't even bother loading wallpapers from some icon packs. Just glad it is free.
57a08f495623ed0942ed8457;Great for art lovers!
57a08f495623ed0942ed8458;Love it!
57a08f495623ed0942ed8459;Can you support daydream??
57a08f495623ed0942ed845a;Nice concept Great implementation, works really well with Android Wear. But, today it suddenly used 300mb of cellular data which is not cool. So I've uninstalled.
57a08f4c5623ed0942ed845b;It's all i ever wanted Very good app, pretty customisable and works beautifully in the background.
57a08f4c5623ed0942ed845c;Unique!! Really awesome wallpaper application!! I love it!! Edit: seems broken on 6.0, wallpapers rarely update.
57a08f4c5623ed0942ed845d;Huge data draining issue. I loved this app and have been using it for a year or two now. Unfortunately last night I ran into a HUGE issue where it consumed all 10gb of my mobile data plan over night. I'm now throttled to unbearably slow speeds with 3+ weeks left in my billing cycle. I can't risk encountering this bug again so unfortunately I'll need to uninstall this app.
57a08f4e5623ed0942ed845e;Fantastic. Just one minor thing... Wish it had more works from the Americas and Asia.
57a08f4e5623ed0942ed845f;Needs changing! Most paintings are not properly cropped. They have white edges on top and bottom which makes the wallpaper look unappealing. Either give us an option to zoom into the painting a bit and keep it that way or just recrop the bunch. Thanks!
57a08f4e5623ed0942ed8460;Galaxy S7 Edge Support? Doesn't seem to want to work on the S7 edge, tells me to select it from the wallpaper screen but doing so gives me an "application not installed" error.
57a08f515623ed0942ed8461;Great app, loving the wide support from the community. One issue and would like to be implemented, I only use one pane and at the moment it crops my wallpaper and wont display the whole wallpaper, kinda sucks. 5 stars if that will be implemented, but I guess 4* for now :)
57a08f515623ed0942ed8462;Great app, but needs to update Option to disable pleaee
57a08f515623ed0942ed8463;Works perfectly, until it doesn't For the most part, very seamless and customisable although sometimes it will be "stuck" on one wallpaper. I'd give it 4.5/5
57a08f555623ed0942ed8464;My favorite wallpaper for years. Friends and family are always asking what my wallpaper is, and I love the consistency between my Android watch and my phone. I also really appreciate that I can ask it to show the artwork on lock screen and then dim and blur when I unlock my phone to reduce visual clutter. 4 stars based on lack of customization on watch face. Would use daily if I could see the weather and battery level at a glance. I would also be totally impressed with this watch face if when it went into ambient mode you could still see a black and white contrasted version of the current painting.
57a08f555623ed0942ed8465;Makes the home screen much more beautiful!
57a08f555623ed0942ed8466;Nice It is nice and works well. I feel like I have seen all the art before in college and at museums, wish it were a little more invigorating.
57a08f575623ed0942ed8467;Additional Features needed. I have been using this app for over 4 months now. I really love it but one thing I find should be there which obviously isn't is the ability to choose which part of the image is displayed on the screen or the ability to resize it so everything comes in. (This is for the updated paintings everyday)
57a08f575623ed0942ed8468;Drained 1gb of data randomly
57a08f575623ed0942ed8469;Turn off background data... Great app except when I went out and had data on it used 1.29gb in a 4 hour span.... With my phone plan I only have 50mb data and after that every 50mb is $5....
57a08f5a5623ed0942ed846a;High Memory Usage Great app, but uses 85-120mb of ram, even with blur and dim off. Needs to always be in memory, so really not ideal.
57a08f5a5623ed0942ed846b;Good app Simple app that takes out the hassle of me switching my wallpaper
57a08f5a5623ed0942ed846c;Data hog Used to love this app. Had to promptly uninstall it when my carrier reported I'm way over my data limit. In just a few hours it used over 4gb. I confirmed in the settings that "refresh only on wifi" was true and had been checked all day. Not sure what happened but now I'm paying the price on my carrier bill.
57a08f5a5623ed0942ed846d;On my OnePlus X, several wallpapers are not showing in full. Just an ugly black space covering the lower quarter of the wallpaper.
57a08f5c5623ed0942ed846e;Love it. 1 suggestion! This is my go-to wallpaper app. I am wondering if the dev could add a setting to decide if the wallpaper chosen can be shown in full rather than the zoom currently. Its not easy to explain, but the photos coming in from Reddit are high resolution and muzei shows pixels at 1:1 with phone resolution. Would like option to zoom out or show the whole image? Hopefully you know what I mean.
57a08f5c5623ed0942ed846f;Works ok High battery drainage. Using htc one m7
57a08f5c5623ed0942ed8470;Locks up The pictures get stuck and won't advance until it does so of its own volition.
57a08f5f5623ed0942ed8471;Custom time neededdd and Widget Widget needed please, best one A widget to quickly change the wallpaper and more option for time interval (30, 15, 5...) would be great :). Best one thought :)
57a08f5f5623ed0942ed8472;Images unclear from smugmug I like it but when using the smugmug the images appear really blocky. As if it is not download all the way.
57a08f5f5623ed0942ed8473;Rating Amazing application! Easy to use, and awesome wallpapers!
57a08f5f5623ed0942ed8474;Superb Such a wonderful app that adds a bit of joy to life
57a08f625623ed0942ed8475;Concept is impressive
57a08f625623ed0942ed8476;The best wallpaper app ever!!
57a08f645623ed0942ed8477;Great but needs more settings It's a beautiful wallpaper app with much extensibility but little customisability.
57a08f645623ed0942ed8478;Takes too much ram
57a08f645623ed0942ed8479;Your music extension Just awesomeüòäüòäüòä
57a08f645623ed0942ed847a;Great app! Recommend using the Landscape wallpaper Muzei source with this.
57a08f645623ed0942ed847b;Not there yet!! Can't set basic functions like setting up an update interval.
57a08f665623ed0942ed847c;Stops working on s7 edge
57a08f665623ed0942ed847d;Awesome application, masterpieces together
57a08f665623ed0942ed847e;Super Nice
57a08f665623ed0942ed847f;Good But bug report I can't have the wallpaper as a lockscreen wallpaper on my one plus two hope you guys can fine a way around it its pretty annoying! But the app itself is great! Would recommend!
57a08f665623ed0942ed8480;In love In love with this app guys. Seriously awesome. Must try once guys. Believe me. This is a Aweosme app ! üòçüòç
57a08f6a5623ed0942ed8481;Favorite wallpaper app as I always used "stock" material wallpapers because I could never decide on ONE photo, plus I didn't like the look of photos with "my" app layout. By allowing Muzei the ability to rotate my photos, I don't have to decide on one. PLUS and BIGGEST, is the blurry option that allows my apps to stand out against the photo and bring photo into focus with a double tap.
57a08f6a5623ed0942ed8482;Can you just choose a folder... Is it possible to customize and just choose a folder with pictures that you want to use as wallpapers? Instead of adding every picture 1 by 1...
57a08f6a5623ed0942ed8483;Really enjoying this wallpaper app so far ‚ò∫
57a08f6d5623ed0942ed8484;Fantastic way to view wallpaper! I've been using this app for over 2 years on Samsung and Motorola devices with absolutely no problems. Just remember to configure Your launcher (I use Nova Prime) to Muzei so all you have to do is double tap your screen to change images or adjust your settings. This app allows lots of customization options. Muzei also has endless extensions so you will never be bored with the same old photos again. I've experienced no major battery drain and no bugs. Highly recommended!
57a08f6d5623ed0942ed8485;Need some work The app is good but plz enable a setting where we can choose a refresh period for wallpaper for each and every plug-in
57a08f6d5623ed0942ed8486;Four thumbs up Can developers add downloading feature to the plugin. Some of these wallpapers are really awesome to keep
57a08f705623ed0942ed8487;Love this app. Personalisation is easy with this.
57a08f705623ed0942ed8488;Beautifull but full of bugs Your app is brilliant but it has a lot of bugs :( Last night i turned my phone off and today turned it back on and the wallpaper wasn't working. So i deinstalled it and installed it agiain. Also i have a bug that blurring and dimming isn't working. Also i have put some picture and it bugged down and always stayed with thath picture. When you fix all this you will get 5 stars. Sent from Lg G2 (internacional)
57a08f705623ed0942ed8489;Love it every day It's a joy to open my phone and see the new art for the day.
57a08f735623ed0942ed848a;Conflict with Marshmallow's Doze feature? I've noticed that the background hasn't been updating automatically lately. Is this a problem with Muzei and Doze?
57a08f735623ed0942ed848b;Works well The ability to save some of the wall papers would be great. I had some really cool ones that I wanted to keep but couldn't find them
57a08f735623ed0942ed848c;Amazing It's always so hard for me to decide which wallpaper should I use, but now that I came across this app it made the process so much easier. You've done a marvellous job on making this the perfect app for people like me. However, I believe that it would be a great idea to add something like a gesture that would change the wallpaper automatically, if you wish to skip it without opening the app. It would be quite useful. All in all, you deserve all the stars in the world!
57a08f755623ed0942ed848d;Does pretty much what I wanted. Using the reddit extension and some subs are hit-and-miss. Would love to see some daydream support for it.
57a08f755623ed0942ed848e;Brilliant Does exactly what it says on the tin...
57a08f755623ed0942ed848f;Nice However I'd like to be able to set the wallpaper change TIME
57a08f755623ed0942ed8490;Awesome
57a08f755623ed0942ed8491;I just love it !!! Used it for about a year, not sure if I willl ever go back :) BTW I would like to thank the people who pick the art every day :)
57a08f785623ed0942ed8492;Hey Please fix it it drains my battery and it heats up my cpu of the phone really? And it mostly drains my battery more please fix two stars for now please fix it's a beautiful app please work on it more thx
57a08f785623ed0942ed8493;Excellent app.. I love it That's for sure
57a08f785623ed0942ed8494;Minizter Wow this gives a new way of viewing art wow
57a08f7a5623ed0942ed8495;Good app, could use much needed improvements Good app, does the job. Here are a few improvementd this app desperately needs: (samsung GS4) Use an other time selection for the rotation timer, this one doesnt go above 9h, and is badly designed. Add the option to blacklist certain wallpapers. A few more effects to the advanced tab, like sepia or Hue. Otherwise it's great, get it if you use an icon pack!
57a08f7a5623ed0942ed8496;Love this üòä
57a08f7a5623ed0942ed8497;I used to love it but.. Double tap doesnt work on s6 edge. Please fix it. Its useless otherwise.
57a08f7d5623ed0942ed8498;I love the images, but for some reason my Samsung Gear live does not update its face when the wallpapers on my phone change. Has anyone else had this issue?
57a08f7d5623ed0942ed8499;Most of the paintings I love. I like that I can blur the paintings so that my icons are easy to see. Then I can just double tap to see the picture clearly. A great app for wallpaper. Thank you :)
57a08f7d5623ed0942ed849a;Amazing This app is great and makes my homescreen look amazing.
57a08f7d5623ed0942ed849b;Uses waaaayy too much ram than I thought I thought this was just a light live wallpaper but someone pointed out it was using 70mb idle wtf.
57a08f825623ed0942ed849c;Problem! Please fix! When double taping on home screen the focus doesn't change, i use samsung galaxy s6! Help! I would give 5 stars if this work with me üëç
57a08f825623ed0942ed849d;Amazing experience, love all the extra extensions.
57a08f825623ed0942ed849e;Combining Muzei and Backdrops is an awesome idea. The only improvement I would suggest is to allow wallpapers from multiple sources rather than only being able to select one.
57a08f875623ed0942ed849f;Great idea It is really cool and I like it a lot, but due to the double tap feature I cannot focus the picture due to my phone having a double tap screen off feature, I would suspect that it will be seen more and more affecting more users. I suggest being able to chose the amount of taps; say one, or one long one, or a custom delay between the taps.
57a08f875623ed0942ed84a0;Great idea It's great overall,but there is an issue with redraws when hitting the home button. Half of the wallpaper is black sometimes, takes about half a second to draw the rest of the wallpaper. It takes away from the experience, it feels cheap when it does that.
57a08f8a5623ed0942ed84a1;Simply the best. There are lots of awesome wallpaper applications out there but none can be compared to Muzei. I have tried a lot of them but I always end up setting this as my default wallpaper application.
57a08f8a5623ed0942ed84a2;Art? I'm not sure if this is a good idea for mobile devices. Its functionality of changing the wallpaper at different intervals is handy, but ultimately not a tool that's needed. The art focus isn't the best way to market this app.
57a08f8a5623ed0942ed84a3;why the wallpaper is blurry?
57a08f8a5623ed0942ed84a4;Nice. Just one problem How do you set it to the lock screen?
57a08f8c5623ed0942ed84a5;Doesn't work Works for 10 mins then just disappears or app closes. Nice effects tho.
57a08f8c5623ed0942ed84a6;Wallpaper not changing with backdrops Using with backdrops. The wallpaper is not changing for the time set for a change
57a08f8c5623ed0942ed84a7;Bugs Worked perfectly when I had an gs4 .. double tapping doesn't work with the gs6e ... please sort that out ..
57a08f8c5623ed0942ed84a8;Great idea implemented in beautiful app This application is even must have. It is very helpful for me to not have the same wallpaper every time if I will not change it with my hands. I only have one kind ask to developer, to add wallpaper left/right scrolling ability when changind desktop pages.
57a08f8f5623ed0942ed84a9;Nice app uses few resources and displays what I want to see or things I've never seen.
57a08f8f5623ed0942ed84aa;‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
57a08f8f5623ed0942ed84ab;Pls Add manual wallpaper switch when using photos on device.
57a08f8f5623ed0942ed84ac;Loved it earlier love it even more now With the addition of addons this app keeps my wallpapers fresh every day. Great way to personalize a phone.

57a08f915623ed0942ed84ae;No longer updates After an update on my HTC One M8 muzei no longer updates the wallpaper
57a08f915623ed0942ed84af;Should've implemented run-time permissions by now.
57a08f995623ed0942ed84b0;Great Great app even syncs with my comic reader app and sets the wallpaper to my android where watch which is a nice feature however the ability to add widgets on Android where would be nice and potentially the option to adjust when the wallpaper changes throughout the day and how often
57a08f995623ed0942ed84b1;Refreshing The app by itself will refresh your wallpaper daily with curated art from the past. Muzei is your personal museum that you are able to curate yourself with extensions or pictures that you hand select and will go through them based on time intervals. Get this in addition to the Form watch face for a treat (Android Wear).
57a08f995623ed0942ed84b2;Hate the recent update I love this app but the recent update is making the app crash and I am unable to see the wallpaper :(
57a08f9c5623ed0942ed84b3;As I expected Please add some functions like triple tap to change wallpaper, parallax effect.
57a08f9c5623ed0942ed84b4;Double tap timer too short There should be a setting to control the length of time an image will remain crystal clear before going back to its blurred state. Other than that, excellent app.
57a08f9c5623ed0942ed84b5;Blurry wallpapers Really disliked the blurry wallpapers. The app has a double tap feature and it makes it clear but it will be reset back to blurry eventually. Just wanted an app that can change wallpaper from one picture to the next, nothing more than that. Couldn't find a way to disable the blurriness. Seems to be missing an important feature.
57a08f9f5623ed0942ed84b6;Facing issues with nexus 6P Hi team, I am using muzei to update my wallpaper from sources at Tumblr. It was working smoothly with nexus 5 on Android 5. Now I have upgraded to nexus 6P and I am facing issues with Muzei. The wallpaper doesn't get updated either automatically or manually.  Please rectify. Regards, HB
57a08f9f5623ed0942ed84b7;This app lets you change your wallpaper automatically. There are many choices of image source, including specific albums on google photos. Brilliant. It also integrates well with some launchers.
57a08f9f5623ed0942ed84b8;Improving The application has become more stable. The "Apply blur to the lockscreen" setting doesn't work on stock Android 6.0.1
57a08fa15623ed0942ed84b9;Fantastic LWP App This LWP App is Amazing. In my opinion It's no.1 LWP app in play store . I suggest you guys to try this app it's awesome and thanks to the developer who made this amazing LWP app
57a08fa15623ed0942ed84ba;Beautiful I love the pictures changing. I use the classical art on my phone and the space images on my tablet.
57a08fa15623ed0942ed84bb;Amazing Free, Beautiful, Ad-free, no incessant asking to rate app, great art and its history
57a08fa45623ed0942ed84bc;Works great Does what it says, changes wallpapers set to whatever time you want. Can have your own custom pics or grab the add ons. The reddit one is really easy to use. Just wish there was a way to set a fixed position for each pic and for this app to remember it. You can move it as it's set as your background, but as soon as it changes and comes back the app doesn't remember the last position.
57a08fa45623ed0942ed84bd;Having some trouble loading on the LG v10
57a08fa45623ed0942ed84be;Pretty cool Feels very 'native'.
57a08fa45623ed0942ed84bf;But why so many process errors?
57a08fa75623ed0942ed84c0;Used lots of day without asking Randomly decided to download over 230MB of something despite the fact I haven't used or opened it in months. Now I barely have any data left and I don't even know what it was that it downloaded.
57a08fa75623ed0942ed84c1;Not compatible with Android 6 The wallpaper rarely changes with Android 6, worked perfectly with 5.
57a08fa75623ed0942ed84c2;I like to change my wallpaper and I can never settle on one. Muzei makes it very easy to do all that in the background. You like dark backgrounds? No problem, you can tweak that in Muzei. Add on wallpaper? Plenty of those to get. I'm very happy with Muzei. Unfortunately the app always crashes now
57a08fac5623ed0942ed84c3;No auto update of wallpapers Loved this app with the bing wallpapers add on but now on my nexus 6p the wallpapers do not update automatically. üòî
57a08fac5623ed0942ed84c4;Blurry I love the photos but they are made blurry if you use them as wallpaper. I have been trying to find a setting that changes that. NOTHING. Unistalled it.
57a08fac5623ed0942ed84c5;Really good Simply amazing, the only complaint would be to pick where I would have the picture, rather than all the way to the left, because when I leave the app, it resets to the part of the picture I don't like. I know that when you swipe to a different screen, you get a different part of the image, but that doesn't cut it for me.
57a08fb15623ed0942ed84c6;Great app but.... I cannot focus the wallpaper by double tapping so I am forced to turn the blur down.
57a08fb45623ed0942ed84c7;Amazing!!! Thank you guys so much for making it free! This is a wonderful gift to Android users. You go, Glen CoCo.
57a08fb45623ed0942ed84c8;This button &gt;&gt; Doesn't change the wallpaper from the app
57a08fb45623ed0942ed84c9;Doesn't blur on lock screen Doesn't blur on lock screen even with option selected.
57a08fb45623ed0942ed84ca;Beautiful work
57a08fb45623ed0942ed84cb;Refreshing issues I set it to go through a few pictures in my gallery every six hours but instead it stays at the same photo for a day at a time sometimes. 6.0 moto x 2014 unlocked.
57a08fb65623ed0942ed84cc;Works sometimes Most times it doesn't update the wallpaper or will not change manually either. Pretty big bug.
57a08fb65623ed0942ed84cd;I love it I like the app but it uses up to much battery life. If you update the app so it so it uses less battery life it would be much better
57a08fb65623ed0942ed84ce;Beautiful.
57a08fb65623ed0942ed84cf;great app. works great now and doesn't crash anymore
57a08fb65623ed0942ed84d0;ok it randomly crashes in the background and I'm not quite sure what that's all about
57a08fb95623ed0942ed84d1;Works great It would be nice if the larger images would scroll left and right with the swipe to move the desktop so you can see the whole image.
57a08fb95623ed0942ed84d2;Best!!!!!!! This is what you need!!! No other app can ever top this!!!
57a08fb95623ed0942ed84d3;It's very good
57a08fb95623ed0942ed84d4;Awesome!!
57a08fb95623ed0942ed84d5;Bugged Double tap doesn't work
57a08fbc5623ed0942ed84d6;Love it, but broken Love the app and works perfectly on my nexus 7, but on my 5x I can't change the image no matter what plugin is used, even the default. It just stays on whatever photo was last used for each plugin, and hitting the next image button does nothing.
57a08fbc5623ed0942ed84d7;Uses too much ram My phone started lagging heavily one day, so I check if an app was taking too much ram. I was disappointed to find that muzei was taking up 150mb+ just by itself.
57a08fc15623ed0942ed84d8;(for the Reddit plugin) So close... I was able to reproduce the multireddit I wanted to manually entering all 20 subreddits, which was a pain, but they stuck. After an hour, the wallpaper (which was set to cycle every 5 minutes) hadn't changed. I had to load the app twice before it pulled another one (edit: then 5 mins later it reverted to the first wallpaper). Double-tapping on the wallpaper is supposed to bring it into focus, but doesn't seem to do anything. Also swiping panes on my start screen doesn't pan the wallpaper like it should.
57a08fc15623ed0942ed84d9;AWESOME APP hello developer i do want to say that this app is great, but can you add the option of a pharallex effect to the wallpaper, that would make it perfect :) !!!!
57a08fc15623ed0942ed84da;Needs a pause button!
57a08fc55623ed0942ed84db;Widget Suggestion It would be nice to have a small widget with the following buttons. Extend life of current image, skip image, favourite button or star scale (to help rank wallpapers if needed on your end), and possibly a quick category switcher button that rotates through installed addons.
57a08fc55623ed0942ed84dc;Watch face Would be nice to have some more options for the accompanying watch face, but otherwise a solid app!
57a08fc55623ed0942ed84dd;Eh I don't get the blur, it just looks like having a blurry dull picture as a wallpaper. Since I always have my wallpaper unblurred I'd like to have double tap change to a new wallpaper.
57a08fc95623ed0942ed84de;Doesn't activate - catch 22 The app didn't launch the wallpaper chooser, and the default live wallpaper selection says the app "isn't installed". Rather strange.
57a08fc95623ed0942ed84df;Good Great app but Double tap to remove Blur doesn't work on my Galaxy A8 Touchwiz
57a08fc95623ed0942ed84e0;Great Wallpaper App Really unique curated wallpaper concept and the classic artwork is great. Wish there was a wider variety of content sources and high quality 3rd party content providers but this should honestly be a standard built in wallpaper experience for mobile and desktop. Great concept and great job executing it.
57a08fcc5623ed0942ed84e1;Amazing Best wallpaper application I've had on Android and the plug ins expanding your selection are icing on the cake.
57a08fcc5623ed0942ed84e2;Force closes every time I try to open All of a sudden, it stopped working. Can't get it selected now, just force closes. Please fix it, as this is one of my absolute favorite apps!
57a08fcc5623ed0942ed84e3;I have no problem when it comes to the phone side of things but the Android wear watch face can be a little better. As in more customization to the actual clock face.
57a08fcc5623ed0942ed84e4;Bug! Can't run, needs to activate first, it says... But going to the wallpaper settings, it says app isn't installed.
57a08fce5623ed0942ed84e5;Must have app I love this app... This is must have app for me.
57a08fce5623ed0942ed84e6;The disability is really bad It could be so good but it's really hard to use and relies heavily on plugins. Ie it has no built in automatic image change and no multiple source selector.
57a08fce5623ed0942ed84e7;Bug or short sight design This app does beautiful WP and the plug-in with other photo apps is good. However it has an enormous bug, the WP cycles unpredictably. Once I got the WP I like, there is no way to keep it. That crappy app replaces with a new one a few hours later.
57a08fce5623ed0942ed84e8;Good ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ≥ÿ™€å ÿØŸÜÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ¥ ÿ®ŸàÿØŸÖ.
57a08fd25623ed0942ed84e9;Love It! Unfortunately on the LG phones double tapping the screen doesn't in blur the background, but rather turns off the screen of you have that option on (don't know if you can turn the option off yet) but none the less still a great background app!
57a08fd25623ed0942ed84ea;Double tapping doesn't work on Samsung s6 edge. Fix it please.
57a08fd25623ed0942ed84eb;Too few customizations What it needs is a setting that allows you to set a specific time cycle when to automatically change wallpaper.
57a08fd25623ed0942ed84ec;üòç Amazing
57a08fd95623ed0942ed84ed;Recently pictures stop changing every once in a while.
57a08fd95623ed0942ed84ee;Amazing App You can't go wrong with this app. Love the different art work that is displayed each day.
57a08fdb5623ed0942ed84ef;Used to be perfect but since moving to Marshmallow the wallpapers rarely update (probably due to Doze?) and the next button doesn't work anymore unfortunately - no new pictures are loaded.
57a08fdb5623ed0942ed84f0;Great app This is a great app. Nothing quite does what Muzei does, unfortunately I had to install and here's why. It was just too resource intensive. 124 MB used puts it up there with Google hangouts. There is simply no need for that. Once uninstalled on my Nexus 6, my phone immediately sped up again. There's no question in my mind what the culprit was.
57a08fdb5623ed0942ed84f1;Awesome The best one
57a08fdb5623ed0942ed84f2;Glitching Solid black background.
57a08fdd5623ed0942ed84f3;Museum in my pocket!
57a08fdd5623ed0942ed84f4;Bug Sometimes it won't change wallpaper
57a08fdd5623ed0942ed84f5;Loved it. It's just amazing ...Some days u might feel to uninstall it but bear it for that day....
57a08fdd5623ed0942ed84f6;Xperia M4 Loving it
57a08fe15623ed0942ed84f7;Great, except for a small problem I installed this because I was looking for an app that would set the album cover of what I listen to as my lockscreen wallpaper. To do that, I had to download an additional extension, and it works for that, except, about 50% of the time, the lower part of the album cover is chopped off, and replaced with blankness. I did a google search and can't find anyone else having this problem.
57a08fe15623ed0942ed84f8;Good! But please fix! I am using a Galaxy S6 Edge and I can't double tap to blur.. I can only use it with a third party launcher..
57a08fe15623ed0942ed84f9;Love this app feature request: home screen shortcut for 'Next artwork'
57a08fe55623ed0942ed84fa;It's awesome but... The double tap doesn't work on my s6 please fix it
57a08fe55623ed0942ed84fb;Absolutely love this app I've used it on my GS3 for a long time. Recently upgraded to the GS6 and now I find that the double click to unblur does not work. Is this known or fixable?
57a08fe55623ed0942ed84fc;been using this app for awhile and i love it! easily 5 stars...however after my recent upgrade to the note 5 the double tap to unblur no longer works....please fix this as its one of my favorite feature of the app
57a08fe85623ed0942ed84fd;Like it, but Without the ability to properly crop I can't get it to show what I want. As much as I love seeing just the left part of backgrounds, I just have this feeling I'm missing half the picture. Also, issues on M? Seems it keeps getting pushed out of running tasks, hourly refresh taking literal days to occur.
57a08fe85623ed0942ed84fe;New experience every day Love finding out that my wallpaper has changed and the history behind the new paintings! Very handy to change the blur, gray scale, etc.
57a08fe85623ed0942ed84ff;Excellent app. Make my Home screen neat and beautiful
57a08feb5623ed0942ed8500;I would give 5 stars but when u change to another wifi the wallpapers stop changing so if u can fix that I will give 5 stars
57a08feb5623ed0942ed8501;It works again :D This app used to crash all the time, now it doesn't, what else must I say?
57a08feb5623ed0942ed8502;Keeps force closing
57a08feb5623ed0942ed8503;Gorgeous app
57a08fed5623ed0942ed8504;UAU One (and probably the best) of the most beautiful wallpaper apps from android. I try a lot and are always the same. this one totally shocks since the beggining. Super beatiful and extremely simple!! Deviantart extension the best!!
57a08fed5623ed0942ed8505;I used to love it, but it is broken in Marshmallow.
57a08fed5623ed0942ed8506;Works perfectly. Much better replacement for the buggy Reddit Autowallpaper app. Very customizable and no ads, which is fantastic.
57a08fed5623ed0942ed8507;Android wear version is buggy Keeps switching to a wallpaper that's not selected when disconnected from the phone. Never had a problem until this latest update. I hope this gets fixed soon.
57a08fef5623ed0942ed8508;Can you pop in an option to disable wallpaper scrolling?
57a08fef5623ed0942ed8509;Best Live Wallpaper Application Trust me its the best live wallpaper application on android market right now. Install it with your eyes closed. You wont regret it.
57a08fef5623ed0942ed850a;Muzei brings smile! Open source with great third party support. Best wallpaper app. Love it.
57a08fef5623ed0942ed850b;Backgrounds do not change at interval in setting and will not change when manually skipped.
57a08ff25623ed0942ed850c;love the concept. But fix this double tap doesnt work on samsung galaxy S6....Until then ill have to keep the blur down to zero.
57a08ff25623ed0942ed850d;Great app Works flawlessly.
57a08ff25623ed0942ed850e;I'd prefer a widget instead of a notification to change to the next wallpaper
57a08ff25623ed0942ed850f;Missing Something? Can't find (1) the option to simply select a folder, (2) automatically shrink or crop picture to fit the screen, (3) tap to immediately rotate, (4) save & export settings
57a08ff55623ed0942ed8510;great but why there's no longer the wallpaper from ghibli's?
57a08ff55623ed0942ed8511;Great app, but cannot work perfect with EMUI 3.1: when I set wallpaper by Musei, the background of status bar and dock cannot change. Please fix it, thanks.
57a08ff55623ed0942ed8512;Beautifully done!
57a08ff55623ed0942ed8513;Ok Ok
57a08ffe5623ed0942ed8514;I hate live wallpapers. Love this! I keep trying live wallpapers and end up removing them. Came across this one and installed, applied and..... WOW! Looks awesome and changes ones a day to a new famous painting which is blurred as wallpaper but can be seen in all it's glory when opening the app. I haven't tried the other options using my own pics or other wallpaper sources yet. Regardless, this is a keeper and again, WOW!
57a08ffe5623ed0942ed8515;Great but.. Have a problem on the galaxy s6 that the double tap does not work on home screen pls fix

57a0900a5623ed0942ed8524;Every now and again it's a pain, but overall a good app It's a great live wallpaper, my only issue with it is sometimes it gets de-centered and then it's a real pain to get it properly centered again. But other than that, works like a charm.

57a093595623ed09ac762657;Locks up all the time Was great but everytime I open it it locks up then closes. I would've given it a 5 star.
57a0935b5623ed09ac762658;Crashes Soon after launching and browsing a little, it crashes... I'm on a custom ROM. CM 13 using a OnePlus 2
57a0935b5623ed09ac762659;The only problem i have is not all the pics i download go to my gallery. Fix please.
57a0935b5623ed09ac76265a;Crashes too often. App seems to crash very often when opening up wallpapers. Running a Note5.
57a0935b5623ed09ac76265b;Usually don't bother giving the bad reviews. This one demanded one. The Wallpapers don't download , what a waste of time.
57a0935e5623ed09ac76265c;Keeps on crashing Used to be one of the best wallpaper sources..but its nearly impossible for the app to remain open for more than 30 seconds

57a093615623ed09ac762660;Crashes after a minutes or two every time. Doesn't save walls properly 75% of the time Sometimes, the wallpapers save normally. Most of the time, though, they don't save through the app or to the phone's gallary. It crashes all the time, usually after tapping on a wall, sometimes when just scrolling down. It's incredibly frustrating, especially because the app is fantastic for like 25% of the time. Please fix.
57a093615623ed09ac762661;Keeps crashing whenever i try to view a wallpaper and get the error 'unfortunately wally has stopped'. Please fix this.
57a093615623ed09ac762662;poor don't come why
57a093645623ed09ac762663;Piracy and Plagerism This app is not only an imitation of Backdrops, but also noticeably includes images from Backdrops. Backdrops has a strict All Rights Reserved policy! In addition, I am shocked to see sexual imagery. I am not interested in female breasts or behinds!

57a093685623ed09ac762668;Alive or not Has this app been abandoned? Keeps crashing every now and then. Totally unstable
57a093685623ed09ac762669;It Must Be Lonely At The Top Nothing else in the category of wallpaper apps can compare to Wally. To spend time looking for a better choice would be a waste of time, you've already found the best!
57a093685623ed09ac76266a;Wonderful app but Its really a nice app for anime wallpapers but now its crashing multiple times.....even after the latest update ....pls fix it

57a093725623ed09ac762678;Did not work. Just kept thinking and thinking but never showed me a single picture.

57a093755623ed09ac76267b;app is broken ... fix it
57a093755623ed09ac76267c;Very nice database A little bit of everything featured here. Could do with a refresh of the popular or trending photos though, but such a minor gripe.
57a093755623ed09ac76267d;I've used this app for a long time, but just started running into a strange problem. A bunch of my downloaded wally wallpapers seem to have been corrupted. I can't open them in the gallery. File explorer finds them but they don't open. I thought at first it might be something wrong w/ phone but it's a brand new phone and the Wally folder is the only one with missing/corrupted pictures. Any help? Other than this issue it's a good app. Wish there were more filtering options though.
57a093765623ed09ac76267e;Awesome app
57a093765623ed09ac76267f;Nice wallpapers... Needs min. 1mbps network connection to work as the wallpaper loading & saving is slow.
57a093765623ed09ac762680;Awesome
57a093765623ed09ac762681;Amazing
57a093765623ed09ac762682;Unsatisfied Tells me that cannot fetch the images.

57a093785623ed09ac762685;Best of the lot Awesome selection, resolution and speed. But what I liked the most was filters for portrait wallpapers. Such a simple and necessary function many apps miss.
57a093785623ed09ac762686;best wallpaper app ever! it's just perfect
57a093785623ed09ac762687;Does not open just a spinning arrow in center of screen
57a0937d5623ed09ac762688;Great!!
57a0937d5623ed09ac762689;Wallpaper App of Choice For a long time no had used one wallpaper app because...well...most of them were atrocious. Coming across Wally I thought "Why not"? Within the first day Wally became my wallpaper app of choice. Wally has a larger selection, better resolution on more images, and more selection on how the image is handled. For wallpaper apps, this is hands down my app of choice. Highly recommended!
57a0937d5623ed09ac76268a;The best! This is the best wallpaper app I have ever found. Only if you can add an option for high-quality preview.
57a0937f5623ed09ac76268b;One of the best Really like it! No bug so far. Nice wallpaper though. Need swipe from left screen to choose the category and need more wallpaper. Keep up the good work, guys!

57a093975623ed09ac7626c0;Awesome app! Really love this app. Simple, no ads and great wallpapers. Thanks!
57a093995623ed09ac7626c1;Best I install this first every time
57a093995623ed09ac7626c2;It's beautiful but.. It's awesome but it caused my launcher to crash showing just a black screen... Finally after trying everything I force closed Wally.. And I was back... Uninstalled.. :-\
57a093995623ed09ac7626c3;Marshmallow Love this app but it crashes a LOT on marshmallow
57a093995623ed09ac7626c4;Like it.. Cool app but crashes randomly..nexus6p Android 6.0
57a0939c5623ed09ac7626c5;Just spins and spins.... Used to work great, the website is awesome and I really liked this app. As of a few weeks ago all it does is spin, it is a cool spin, but and endless one. I wish the developer would fix this so that it would work again.
57a0939c5623ed09ac7626c6;Great app One annoying thing is I can't scroll through them while they are full screen. I don't want to click each one, then preview in full screen.
57a0939c5623ed09ac7626c7;Good
57a0939c5623ed09ac7626c8;Awesome

57a0939d5623ed09ac7626ce;Awesome Could you please add the image size in the information panel.?
57a093a15623ed09ac7626cf;Great app. Great site. But.. Any chance of adding login support? I realise that it can't be done due to the site having NSFW and Google's policy but what about a fork in the code since it's now open source and available outside the play store? Just an idea. Still a fantastic app.
57a093a15623ed09ac7626d0;Good job Keeps getting better with every update. :)
57a093a15623ed09ac7626d1;Great, almost. Great selection, which is the only reason it stays installed. Full screen previews crash app pretty consistently, I'd say about 75% of the time. Running Android 6.0 on a Nexus 6.
57a093a15623ed09ac7626d2;It was great but it hasn't had an update in nearly 6 months. I hope the dev is alright..
57a093a25623ed09ac7626d3;Love it Best wallpaper app ever
57a093a25623ed09ac7626d4;Pretty Good Decent variety
57a093a25623ed09ac7626d5;Nothing new No new wallpaper since i first installed which was last year

57a093a25623ed09ac7626d7;Best wallpapers ever Seriously, the best I've seen period
57a093a65623ed09ac7626d8;Kinda okay When I click on the save button it shows that its but when I see the saved images folder its not there...!!! Some issue that is...!!!!
57a093a65623ed09ac7626d9;Very good. But nexus 5 stock marshmallow. Crash on zoom and pan images. Other wise 4 stars.
57a093a65623ed09ac7626da;1 of the best apps Best wallpaper app ever
57a093a65623ed09ac7626db;The best wallpapers available No bs, this app has QHD tasteful wallpapers that actually look great on any phone if any con it would be the load times on some wallpapers but beside that it's a must have app
57a093a85623ed09ac7626dc;Perfecto !!!
57a093a85623ed09ac7626dd;The best !
57a10a335623ed119350d09c;Does not detect root on marshmallow I really like this application when it works to disable event conditions that start apps. Unfortunately it no longer detects root on my Galaxy S7 with systemless root su 2.71 or 2.68. Please make this compatible.
57a10a3a5623ed119350d09d;DoesnÔøΩ€™t work anymore No go for S6 or S7
57a10a3e5623ed119350d09e;developer abandoned does not work on recent devices. developer abandoned this app back in 2014. do not buy.
57a10a3f5623ed119350d09f;Overall, great app to have and use. lately i'm having a little problem. I'm using an HTC One M9 and its rooted but when I got to disable something. the app isn't letting me. I guess it is telling me that I don't have root when I know I do. has anyone experienced this lately?
57a093a85623ed09ac7626de;Simply the best!!
57a093a85623ed09ac7626df;Keep the good work
57a093a85623ed09ac7626e0;Must have if u r a wallpaper fan!
57a093a85623ed09ac7626e1;Variety is the spice of life Really great wallpaper app, brilliant with Muzei, amazing variety and choice of images ...
57a093ab5623ed09ac7626e2;In one Word THE BEST Great app..
57a093ab5623ed09ac7626e3;The best I have used many wallpaper apps before but nothing compares to the library and images within this app. Absolutely the best I have come across

57a093ab5623ed09ac7626e6;Yes So far I like it
57a093b15623ed09ac7626e7;Almost There! Great filters and custom resolution tools provided. What you can improve is make the interface more lively,add tabs like daily walls. Obviously there is always scope to improve your library of higher resolution wallpapers (4k)
57a093b15623ed09ac7626e8;Awesome animations!
57a093b35623ed09ac7626e9;Best app so far for me You can get very high resolution wallpapers and they are pretty much awesome
57a093b35623ed09ac7626ea;Now this is how a wallpaper app is supposed to be like It's got everything one needs.
57a093b35623ed09ac7626eb;Good The app is good but when I power off my phone and then turn it back on the image becomes large :( plz fix it

57a093b65623ed09ac7626f0;Lots and lots of fanservice... ...if you're into women. Not so much if you're into guys. That aside, a lot of the wallies are nice. Lack of permissions required are a welcome change from apps that want to get uber intimate with your device.

57a093ce5623ed09ac76270f;Too many crashes! The app hangs and crashes frequently when opening or downloading high resolution images. Cannot browse any further once the app crashes as i have to scroll down to the last image everytime it crashes. Using Android 5 on Galaxy S5.

57a093dc5623ed09ac762725;No working It's my fav app for wallpapers but I tried using it today and it's not showing any pictures. It's not working. The only thing I can see is the loading sign rotating again and again. Please fix it...
57a093dc5623ed09ac762726;Much Improved! It's back to the great app it started out as. Well done! Thanks for the improvements.
57a093dc5623ed09ac762727;Stellar app !

57a093de5623ed09ac76272a;Best wallpaper art It has only 100k downloads ? People really are ignorant... This app must be the number one wallpaper app.
57a093de5623ed09ac76272b;Spectacular One of the best apps I have ever seen.
57a093de5623ed09ac76272c;Impressive ui I like the ui more than the wallpapers. Nice use of material design with a touch of personalization.
57a093de5623ed09ac76272d;Amazing Love the variations
57a093e15623ed09ac76272e;SHOCKING This, without a doubt, is the best wallpaper app I have ever used. EVER.

57a093e15623ed09ac762730;Something went wrong while fetching the images :(
57a093e15623ed09ac762731;Good Very good for tablets
57a093e45623ed09ac762732;Best Used plenty of apps....but no one have a variety to satisfy.... Until then I installed Wally..... Seriously guys if you are looking for a wallpaper app this is BEST....Only issue is that there is no category option.....but I am fine with it....!!!
57a093e45623ed09ac762733;NOT MUCH SELECTION..... NEEDS WORK...... I HAVE NO TIME FOR THIS JUNK ON MY PHONE......
57a093e45623ed09ac762734;Simple & clean,without unnecessary promissions

57a093f45623ed09ac762744;Best in class!
57a093f45623ed09ac762745;Amazing Fav wallpaper app by far. Suck it Deviant!
57a093f45623ed09ac762746;Wicked wallpapers Although when applying the wallpapers they are zoomed in even though they match my screen resolution 1920x1080, any fix for this?
57a093f45623ed09ac762747;Needs more categorization options.
57a093f65623ed09ac762748;Superb
57a093f65623ed09ac762749;The best. Can't give it 5/5 because of some seriously slow preview and viewing issues, but it does what it advertises. I like.
57a093f65623ed09ac76274a;Awesome It seems like I've downloaded hundreds of wallpaper apps, but each of them fail to really impress me. Not this one! It's truly amazing, and worth every star.
57a093f65623ed09ac76274b;T_T I rarely rate any app. I, myself, am an app developer and *this* made me cry! By far the best I've seen! Bravo!
57a093f65623ed09ac76274c;Awesome!! Loved it!!
57a093f95623ed09ac76274d;OMG !! The best one in Play Store. Cant believe its free!!! Best hd wallpapers and have a really brilliant search bar!
57a093f95623ed09ac76274e;Okay
57a093f95623ed09ac76274f;Best best ever I am looking for so so long for app like this and finally :THANKS, THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY MUCH. PERFECT üëå 10. MY NOTE 4 IS LOOKING LIKE 1 MILLION DOLLAR. AGAIN THANK YOU.
57a093f95623ed09ac762750;WOW Have tried a lot of wallpaper app. This is the best
57a093fb5623ed09ac762751;Works well Finally a decent wallhaven app. My favourite part is that actual 'saved' option.
57a093fb5623ed09ac762752;Wow. Best wallpaper app!
57a093fb5623ed09ac762753;Great app and selections Great selection. Non obtrusive permissions. Great app.
57a093fb5623ed09ac762754;Best Wallpaper I've seen There something for everyone taste.. Sometimes things that you didn't even like. But looks good... Nexus 6 user.
57a093fb5623ed09ac762755;Great app, just missing an option to filter by resolution
57a093fd5623ed09ac762756;Best collections of wallpapers! Can get the best wallpapers especially it has filter features works great. Recommended indeed!
57a093fd5623ed09ac762757;Extremely nice! I'm always searching for wallpaper apps and this one is 5 stars for sure. Loads smoothly not bombarded with ads and an impressive selection. I would actually pay for this. üëç
57a093fd5623ed09ac762758;Luv the variety !
57a093fd5623ed09ac762759;Best wallpaper app out there Ur wallpaper game strongüí™üò¶
57a094015623ed09ac76275a;Absolutely gorgeous!!! Just one question. How is it possible that this is a freemium application?? I'd be willing to pay to support the developer. I've been searching for such an amazing app for a very long time. Before I used to download the pictures from Google but I have had problems with adjusting the resolution to my phone. The wallpaper doesn't fit my phone at all, it even gives me a blur quality of that picture. But now, thank god, this app is existed. The quality of the picture is top-notch. The resolution fits perfectly to my screen ratio. Thank you very much for such an amazing app. I can't stop myself from staring at my phone screen right now. :-)
57a094015623ed09ac76275b;So was about 4 1/2 stars... Was... But now it lags when saving. To a point where after about say twenty minutes or so it just crashes. This is the case for both my phones. So for now I rate it a three. But don't let that stop you. There are some epic wallpapers on here xD
57a094045623ed09ac76275c;No Anime pls 70% of wallpapers are anime I hate them but I like the other
57a094045623ed09ac76275d;Probably best wallpapers out there Looks fresh, wallpapers are by far stunning operates smoothly (even in my slow network) and fills up my SD card with high resolution wallpapers.. Only one thing I hate about it is that you can't stop looking once you are in it.üòÅ
57a094045623ed09ac76275e;Best app for wallpapers The best thing about the app is the simplicity and elegance with which it provides you the wallpapers. Hands down the best designed wallpapers app period.
57a094045623ed09ac76275f;Loved this app This is the 2nd best wallpapers app
57a0940c5623ed09ac762760;Great wallpaper app The use of material design is amazing. Just wished the tending wallpapers would change at least once a week
57a0940f5623ed09ac762761;Nice Downloaded some wonderful wallpapers unto my phone. Kudos to the developer :)
57a0940f5623ed09ac762762;awesome app nice cool wallpapers
57a0940f5623ed09ac762763;Works again!
57a0940f5623ed09ac762764;Awesome Beautifully done awesome picture that fills your whole screen super quality resolution Highly recommend it
57a0940f5623ed09ac762765;Design is good. But Crashes consistently.. Sometimes needs to reinstall.
57a094205623ed09ac762766;Good but very laggy and slow at times using Intel atom device
57a094205623ed09ac762767;Great app. Please add better indentation features: indent/deindent buttons and simple autoindent (copy previous line indent).
57a094205623ed09ac762768;Buggy
57a094205623ed09ac762769;Doesn' t work smoothly with physical keyboard/mouse/touchpad
57a094205623ed09ac76276a;Crash on landscape mode.
57a094245623ed09ac76276b;Shift-key fails to stick, fails to reopen file I like the syntax coloring. It can be improved to detect multiple code styles in an HTML file, for instance. But the inability to make a shift-key stick is rather disastrous. I'm using the Hackers' Keyboard. I haven't had this problem with any other app. Also, even though its settings accept a toggle to reopen the file automatically upon reopening the app, we're met with error messages instead (opening the same html file).
57a094245623ed09ac76276c;Freezing issues On my phone (Galaxy S3 neo) it is unusable due to frequent short freezes. Also, the keyboard's spell check feature cannot be enabled whereas the (for me useless) syntax highlighting cannot be turned off.
57a094255623ed09ac76276d;Google Drive Support Awesome app..... love it.... but would be even better for Google drive support. Unless I have missed it ?
57a094255623ed09ac76276e;Support the devs, donate.
57a094255623ed09ac76276f;Only 601 lines shown I downloaded this app hoping to be able to view my long javascript files on mobile. I was dissapointed to see that only 601 lines are shown in it. Thinking it might be limitation of the free version i paid for paid version still it is showing 601 lines. I am very frustrated and dissapointed . Fix it and help me.
57a094255623ed09ac762770;I use it to make apps
57a094275623ed09ac762771;More syntax color scheme please. Specially Monokai.
57a094275623ed09ac762772;Beautiful app Fully functional, bug free. Like to see FTP support and compiler option for PERL & PHP. Will pay for it of course
57a094275623ed09ac762773;Turbo Editor No backspace delete ?! Went no further. It's probably brilliant apart from that. Months later I forgot I had tried it, and installed it again. This time it seemed good, so I sent 3 leva. This was my mistake ! - it immediately "stopped", and when reloaded has a dark screen with white chars. and not very visible stops and coloured chars - and Sticks upon "swipe scroll" !! Also I don't want line numbers. I want a white screen with clear black chars. How do I get to the "source code" as a matter of interest ?
57a0942a5623ed09ac762774;Looked OK, but it needs major bug fixes to be usable After trying this app out for about 2 minutes, it was freezing for 2-4 seconds every 3 lines of code I was looking through. I'm using KitKat 4.4.2. If you can fix the freezes let me know and I'll try your editor again. I was reading through a .vbs program.
57a0942a5623ed09ac762775;Can't use sliding to write
57a0942a5623ed09ac762776;Best text editor I don't know why everyone is complaining, but I recommend it to anyone wanting to code on the go
57a094305623ed09ac762777;Doesn't save system files Cannot save system files such as feature.xml. it says read only system. Then why the heck do you request for root access?? Why should I trust this app?
57a094305623ed09ac762778;License gone I bought this as at the time it was the best editor, when I was reinstalling my phone I couldn't get back the full version that I had bought, so I was tricked into making a donation for the full version which didn't work. So basically I have paid for this app twice and I won't be giving you anymore money, if you want me to assess the app as a proficient web dev then give me my license back and I will write another review. I am quite sure it was the devs who deleted my licence between versions and not my er
57a094305623ed09ac762779;Text file viewer
57a094395623ed09ac76277a;Aamzing This is the best editor i have ever used in Android, except one problem and i hope you get it fixed soon so i can get the Pro version the problem occurs when i am using my external keyboard i can't use the Shift key its really important because most special characters used in coding are accessible only through Shift and since iam using external keyboard i cant access the row key provided in the app.
57a094395623ed09ac76277b;Is there a cap to the amount of characters I can use?
57a0943e5623ed09ac76277c;Good, unless you have a bluetooth keyboard Works very well and has syntax highlighting with a variety of languages (but doesn't seem to understand some ruby constructs). However, this app ignores anything involving a shift key on my bluetooth keyboard. Other installed apps to register these key combinations. If you only plan to use the on-screen keyboard, this app is awesome. Otherwise, you can do better than an app that will not allow capital letters from your main keyboard.
57a0943e5623ed09ac76277d;Sadly unusable on the Pixel C bluetooth keyboard On the Pixel C keyboard, any character typed in combination with the Shift-key does not show up, like :"!@#$%^&*()&lt;&gt;? This appears to be an easy glitch to fix :)
57a094455623ed09ac76277e;It looks nice but it's unusable for me. It constantly switches cases to lowercase. It sometimes deletes a character I already written and I have to write extremely slow or it will miss half of the word. I didn't have the same problem with other editors, so I will stick with those.
57a094455623ed09ac76277f;JUNK! Keeps popping out of mode. You want Caps, it wants non-caps, you want numbers, it wants text..... Real piece of trash. Deleted!!
57a094455623ed09ac762780;REVOLUTIONARY NEW TEXT METHODS This app is AWESOME. I've always wanted to use a text editor without the keyboard! It's just brilliant! Who would have ever thought of this if it weren't for this developer team? All you get now are punctuation marks at the bottom of the screen. This is because that's all we need. There's no need for silly letters! All I need is ()()(){}{}¬¢¬¢¬¢¬¢¬¢¬∂¬∂‚àÜ#$$&-$+%!';*+!
57a094465623ed09ac762781;Cannot open large file
57a094465623ed09ac762782;My go-to app for quick and efficient code editing. The perfect way to update HTML and other code projects. Support the developer with the pro version.
57a094465623ed09ac762783;Great editor Simple and easy to use. I love taking notes as text files that can be read on my computer instead of memos
57a094465623ed09ac762784;Turbo?!?! This is horribly slow: drag, wait,wait,wait.... my 12mhz 286 did better than this.
57a094465623ed09ac762785;Too many bugs.
57a094475623ed09ac762786;Poor
57a094475623ed09ac762787;When Scrolling down a file it keeps scrolling back up. If its something tell me its annoying.
57a094475623ed09ac762788;very useful
57a094475623ed09ac762789;It's amazing üòÜüòÅ
57a094475623ed09ac76278a;very good. however, the program handles the keyboard a bit annoying and often mistype
57a0944b5623ed09ac76278b;Excellent editor! Great editor with a cool color scheme and also an awesome filebrowser and no ads! best code editor for android I have tried
57a0944b5623ed09ac76278c;Great About time, a nice smooth editor without massive Adverts!

57a094505623ed09ac76278e;Very poor performances It freezes when you try to scroll the code view in a medium sized file, and when even you try to open a second file. Without mentioning that it may crash at any time. It can't be used for serious coding.
57a094505623ed09ac76278f;Unusable with a physical keyboard The program did not allow me to enter any of the necessary symbols for programming except via the accesory bar, which renders it unusable for actually editing code in any reasonable way. Furthermore it would be wise to prerender more of the highlighting (or make an option to do this) so that it doesn't lag when scrolling as much.
57a094505623ed09ac762790;Could be better Can you guys split the screen to view as you edit or create or at least have a viewer mode where you can view your progress.
57a094545623ed09ac762791;Text markup slows down the app Please allow option to disable text color mark up. This slows down the view and causes missing letters when editing text.
57a094545623ed09ac762792;Looks like a great editor, but doesn't seem to work with root files. Any time I try to save a root file it says "An error occurred command number: 3 result code: 1 error lines:", even though it has been granted root permissions in SuperSU.
57a094545623ed09ac762793;Updates can be the worst This text editor used to be very reliable. However, stability was lost after an update. I kept using it anyway, but eventually I had to get a new phone. I sent Gmails to myself to transfer the text files, but this same app on the new phone opened only part of the file. I experienced similar problems with other text editors, until Jota Text Editor was finally able to open the complete file.
57a094565623ed09ac762794;Not bad A little bit of problems hard to explain what is i4
57a094565623ed09ac762795;Icon is not Materialised!!
57a094565623ed09ac762796;Probably the only code editor that saves to the external sd card on lollipop
57a094565623ed09ac762797;Really pleased with it. Functional and neat. Many thanks üòÉ
57a094565623ed09ac762798;Turbo charged Yes it could have more features but then again, hate over bloated apps. It suits my needs. I have about 5 or so similar apps. Each one of them is serving me in a different way.
57a094575623ed09ac762799;Excellent. Simple yet powerful. Color coded view.
57a094575623ed09ac76279a;Good It is good for writing HTML
57a094575623ed09ac76279b;Good enough.
57a094575623ed09ac76279c;Perfect Thought the only thing missing that makes this perfect is search and replace, then I found it. hehe
57a094575623ed09ac76279d;Not that bad. Lacking some features, but it's ok.
57a094595623ed09ac76279e;thanks for open source i was looking for any native editor will learn from your code to develop one. :)
57a094595623ed09ac76279f;Don't waste your time I installed, opened a new file, and pasted. The app would not let me scroll to the top of the page. I was unable to even see the first few lines let alone edit.

57a094595623ed09ac7627a1;It will help you to hack any game I hope so that the program will help me to hack smashy road wanted
57a0945d5623ed09ac7627a2;Nifty, weird about large text files I'm trying to open this text file (.CSV, 300 lines) on my sd card from ES File Explorer to this app. At first I'll get the loading dialog, but then it'll disappear and the "Open File" text will display on a blank background. There's a weird delay before actually displaying. Also, I keep having to move left and right between sections.
57a0945d5623ed09ac7627a3;Slooooow... App slows to a snails pace when typing in code. Would be nice if it could use my phone's Swype feature.
57a0945d5623ed09ac7627a4;Irritating keyboard bug If you switch to symbols, it will immediately go back to letters. I need to switch it to symbols 1 to 2 times before it will go steady to symbols set. Almost always, when i needed to type a special character like '-' or ':', I wrongly type letters instead due to the bug.
57a094605623ed09ac7627a5;No CF for Windows It bugs me that I can't read files I type on my phone in Notepad (because it doesn't see the newlines). In light of this, a CRLF option would be nice.
57a094605623ed09ac7627a6;Well done app! Is it possible to make numbers and preprocessor statements in the code with different colors in C lang? And maybe change an algorithm of syntax highlight because its works with 1 second delay, kinda annoying.. But overall thanks for a good app :D
57a094605623ed09ac7627a7;Buggy and slow
57a094625623ed09ac7627a8;KEYBOARD Useless with a physical (eg bluetooth) keyboard because you can't use the shift key to type symbols. I can't imagine how anyone could use it seriously without that working. Not everybody wants to use the onscreen symbol bar.
57a094625623ed09ac7627a9;Glitch I actually started using turbo ftp client which is terrific. I could not stand the text editor it came with which happens to be this. It has extreamly irritating bugs in it. If you try to switch to characters it will switch back randomly. Same with caps. I was planning on giving the ftp a 3 star cus the text editor is so bad but the client is amazing so 5 stars for client, 1 for editor. Ok I'm off to find another editor!
57a094625623ed09ac7627aa;Can't Create A .js It does not let me create a .js
57a094675623ed09ac7627ab;So far, as i just downloaded it, i wanted to send a buddy of mine in the same Linux class of a bash script that works. Before i downloaded this app i was trying all ways to send a .txt file through sms but i couldn't, until, i found this app, this app was easy to navigate, didn't lag when opening the script. So, as of now 3 stars. I will update my review after I test it out for awhile. Thanks.
57a094675623ed09ac7627ac;No way to set EOL or text encoding When i try to make shell script with this editor, they won't run. This editor makes only unicode text docs. There are no settings to control this. Otherwise its ok.
57a094675623ed09ac7627ad;Really.. Lock = null? EHAT DOES THAT MEAM
57a094675623ed09ac7627ae;Awesome! App does exactly as documented.
57a094695623ed09ac7627af;It's ok Nice colours for some files, but when I click an XML in my file manager this app doesn't come up as an option. XML files should be supported. Also, why is this called "Turbo"... it's so slow at coloring the text. It should cache the colors for an entire file if smaller than 10MB.
57a094695623ed09ac7627b0;Pretty good... But the keyboard is a little glitchy. It's good for writing HTML, which is what I'm doing, though.
57a0946d5623ed09ac7627b1;Works if you don't need shift I use a bluetooth keyboard and downloaded this just to take notes in class. Unfortunately, if I hold the shift key to get a capital letter this program won't type anything. So shift means do nothing. I have to remember to press caps lock and then caps again. It's a larger issue for those symbols though. You can't get symbols by caps lock so I am prevented from using my keyboard for symbols entirely, so I can't take quick notes in computer science lecture. That could use fixing, especially since some symbols like $ is not possible from the bottom menu.
57a0946d5623ed09ac7627b2;I do really like this editor except that it completely ignores the shift key for some reason with an external USB keyboard. I can type abc but ABC comes out completely blank. Thus most punctuation is inaccessible. BTW this was typed on the same external usb keyboard. (add) it also ignores s-pen on Note 4.
57a094715623ed09ac7627b3;Almost perfect but lacks 2 main features. It's a really good text editor. Simple and beautiful. Need some fixations. 1. Manual saving directories. 2. It's main page during opening of app should be replaced by opening new note directly for a fast access so that a new note can be written fastly. Otherwise it is almost a perfect app.
57a094715623ed09ac7627b4;I especially like the auto save.
57a094715623ed09ac7627b5;Overengineered and doesn't deliver Syntax highlighting is slow and causes the keyboard to reset all the time. Also completely disables any recommendation function custom keyboards have, and the UI tries to be pretty, but fails.
57a094755623ed09ac7627b6;This app is very good but i cann't run the code how can i know if the code is not working so go back and make same changes thanks you will get 5 sters its very good app
57a094755623ed09ac7627b7;Take forever to type Half the letters you type need to be pressed 3 times before they will appear. Too slow.
57a094755623ed09ac7627b8;Crashes Crashes when searching for words
57a094755623ed09ac7627b9;USES 23MB ON MY SD DRIVE Many notepads have similar capabilities at 2MB. Does not show up on Samsung Multiwindow. Samsung Tab S 8.4 Android 5.0.2
57a094785623ed09ac7627ba;Good but need to improve functionality The screen is not automaticaly scrolled down when I enter a new line at the bottom of the text area. To see that line I have to scroll the screen manually. The second thing is saving files. App needs to add a path. It's not possible to explore list of folders. Summary, this app is one of the best but needs to improve some functions to be perfect text editor.
57a094785623ed09ac7627bb;Too Slow Each character typed takes a second to appear on the screen. Also when opening files created on another text editor, pound signs appear as a question mark within a diamond.
57a094785623ed09ac7627bc;Can't use my physical keyboard cause SHIFT button doesn't works.
57a0947a5623ed09ac7627bd;on the verge of useful unable to use tabs; replaces with spaces with no option to not. also does not use file browser for save as, just a text box to type a path, which is unacceptable. has potential, i hope to change to a higher score in the future.
57a0947a5623ed09ac7627be;Can it edit games? Say I had 24 coins on clumsy ninja could this be able to edit the amount of coins?
57a0947a5623ed09ac7627bf;Best file editor for android
57a0947a5623ed09ac7627c0;Wtf WHY IT TAKES AN HOUR FOR THIS THING TO OPEN A FILE ???
57a0947d5623ed09ac7627c1;4 It's suits my needs for some tasks. Just wish the Syntax highlight feature would not cause freeze, and slow the experience.
57a0947d5623ed09ac7627c2;Can't save to SD card Permission denied, no clues to figure out the issue
57a0947d5623ed09ac7627c3;Dropbox integration would be nice
57a0947d5623ed09ac7627c4;I really like it but I really like it but I'd like if you added an auto complete or suggestions like in Adobe Brackets since it's really helpful and makes coding faster.
57a0947f5623ed09ac7627c5;Exactly what I Need!
57a0947f5623ed09ac7627c6;Plz fix There is a bug where it crashes whenever i try to rename a file
57a0947f5623ed09ac7627c7;Keep changing to the second language input keyboard setting If ur using other languages like me do, this app does keep changing to the English keyboard.
57a0947f5623ed09ac7627c8;Great except no voice input. If there is a way, let me know.
57a0947f5623ed09ac7627c9;Awesome apps Turbo c app is good to practise but when I compile its not work bcz in this app no compile system
57a094845623ed09ac7627ca;Magnificent But I want to know,why the editor takes a long time to open a file? Does the total amount of codes inside a file affect its speed?
57a094845623ed09ac7627cb;really nice editor really like it......... add ability to have more than one bookmark and it'll deserve 6 stars
57a094845623ed09ac7627cc;I love it but...... The app works great but when I'm making a site using html and css it wont show my pictures on the browser webpage, it will only show the copied url code from the picture, fix this and ill for sure give you five stars! üòä
57a094845623ed09ac7627cd;Must have Best text editor lgsg bs dipake di bawah sistem root
57a094875623ed09ac7627ce;Question Is there a limit to lines? Because I've been trying to type and it doesn't let me type i have 270 lines and more than that it wont let me add more.
57a094875623ed09ac7627cf;Good one It's an amazing app for the same purpose
57a094875623ed09ac7627d0;Good Job Very easy to use editor, but it will be better with some Find & Replace function. It also need a fix for the symbols keyboard bug . This (little) bug is caused by the refresh of the text to highlight the syntax of html. When it refresh, the keyboard go back to the default keyboard (with letters). Fix that and it will be perfect ‚ò∫
57a094875623ed09ac7627d1;No file save dialog, have to type it No options, font size etc. More to complain about!
57a0948c5623ed09ac7627d2;I like it but it has a few bugs Whenever I go to open a file, it defaults to the app's storage directory instead of the main SD card, i.e /sdcard/Android/data/blah blah, but still lists the folders that are in /sdcard. When I then try and open any of these folders there is nothing in them. This is an irritating bug. Fix this and I will up the rating to 5 stars
57a0948c5623ed09ac7627d3;Nice and simple. Would be better if we can open files from cloud too.
57a0948c5623ed09ac7627d4;Good, bit buggy with keyboard edit though.
57a094915623ed09ac7627d5;Neat Enjoy the dark color scheme & specially helpful w/ bluetooth keyboard.
57a094915623ed09ac7627d6;Add Indentation Need add amount each line is spaced in from the margin. This really helps make code more readable.
57a094915623ed09ac7627d7;Add cloud support ‚òÅ Please üôè
57a094915623ed09ac7627d8;lock == null on trying to open any file and navigating to a documents directory which is full of txt, doc, csv and other files, doesn't even show the .txt ones, in fact it doesn't list anything in any directory but shows them all as empty. Shames as this was once good.
57a094945623ed09ac7627d9;Simple and functional Thats how i like apps, without hundreds of permissions or functions but with exact the functions that are helpful and that you need
57a094945623ed09ac7627da;Love it Just simple!
57a094945623ed09ac7627db;No keyboard. This is another typical Android app. I have looked at on a few occasions. It has features I want such as monospaced font for columnar editing. Unfortunately I can't get at a keyboard or full character set. Maybe this is because I don't use a standard Google keyboard. It is typical in the fact that there I so help, hints, or way to ask a question. It wouldn't need more than a paragraph or two of documentation but without it becomes a time consuming frustration rather than the useful app it could be.
57a094975623ed09ac7627dc;Great editor (y)
57a094975623ed09ac7627dd;Can create great stuff! I really love this app, Its given me the ability to work on css, html, and JavaScript. I've created a small fully functional web document with links and pages. Really love the "view online" option. Makes it so much easier to review the style and functionality of each page. Then I drop it into my OneNote and Drop box. Love this app!
57a0949a5623ed09ac7627de;Font No external font support‚Ä¶ actually, no font support at all.
57a0949a5623ed09ac7627df;Very useful This is the only app I found useful, very clean and organized, I would like it has sync with Drive. Thanks.
57a0949a5623ed09ac7627e0;Cannot open the menu to do anything
57a0949a5623ed09ac7627e1;great editor I feel some problem in keyboard, automatically change it, so i can't type 1,2,3,4,5 numerical numbers! plz solve this problem , otherwise,very helpful because of &lt; ,&gt;,!, these three keys! it is so easy for these keys. thank u developers
57a094a95623ed09ac7627e2;Nice but buggy Nice design but serious bugs: Search sometimes does not find what is in file, sometimes crashes the app, scrolling is intermittent, highlighting is buggy e.g. &lt;!-- in xml, no development or responses from author
57a094a95623ed09ac7627e3;Very good guys.... Good work...perfect for beginners...really helped a lot to me......keet it up...whats in ur pro version?
57a094a95623ed09ac7627e4;One issue Enabling swipe input also enables autocorrect, which changes the words without permission. Fix it please
57a094a95623ed09ac7627e5;Good App Love it! Easy to work with!
57a094ad5623ed09ac7627e6;Useful
57a094ad5623ed09ac7627e7;Why the fluff? Probably decent for most, but for me had too many 'magic' widgets that just got in the way of my being able to simply edit
57a094ad5623ed09ac7627e8;Best text editor. Light, compact, easy to use, and sleek. It's perfect for my needs. Update: Two small issues: The keyboard does not pop up when working in landscape mode; and sometimes, you need to press backspace twice to delete a character (only some files do this.) Please look into this; I will promote this app on my Google+ when fixed. (Also: an option to delete files directly from the browser would be nice too.)
57a094b05623ed09ac7627e9;very good app use it with pleasure
57a094b05623ed09ac7627ea;Great app, simple and fast
57a094b05623ed09ac7627eb;Broken Regular expression find and replace Update: Regular expression find and replace broken in the current version and causes a crash when replacing a group. Hope this is fixed soon. An example of RegEx find and replace: find ‚Äú(\d+)\/(\d+)‚Äú replace with ‚Äúday $2 of month $1‚Äú and this ‚Äú10/27‚Äú becomes ‚Äúday 27 of month 10‚Äú. It's the single most powerful feature of regular expressions.
57a094b05623ed09ac7627ec;The best app ever I use it all the time for shaders and work
57a094b15623ed09ac7627ed;How to highlight web links? No way to activate links in text.
57a094c35623ed09ac7627ee;only one account per app there is a feature to add another account but it doesn't work. it only authorizes the previous account. either app is buggy or this is intentional. app also sometimes takes long time to load or it doesn't load at all. uninstalled
57a094c35623ed09ac7627ef;Best app for Twitter There are bugs, close app when trying to open any media and can't watch any media. Hope to improve it soon with marshmallow version.
57a094c35623ed09ac7627f0;Not as good as it used to be Since I got my update to Marshmallow,it crashes every time I click on an image. Hope there will be a bug fix for this.
57a094c35623ed09ac7627f1;Recent update broke pic links. Subject says all.
57a094c65623ed09ac7627f2;Great app, but not work well with Marshmallow It has issue with Marshmallow when click on picture. Otherwise a perfect app.
57a094c65623ed09ac7627f3;Looked promising But every time I clicked on a picture to open it the app crashed so deleted it,Galaxy S6 Edge , Marshmellow.
57a094c65623ed09ac7627f4;Great app but needs inprovement I would give this app 5 stars if it did not freeze up which is quite frequent and if there were a way to block bullies and trolls. They are more prevalent than ever on twitter. This a a much needed feature. Other than these issues it's the best twitter app by far.
57a094c65623ed09ac7627f5;Love it
57a094c85623ed09ac7627f6;Best, but.. Wish it displayed polls. Also every time I click on a picture, app force closes. On Galaxy S7
57a094c85623ed09ac7627f7;Hasn't been updated since Oct 2014 Force closes when opening a picture with Marshmallow. If it could be fixed I'd definitely stay with this app, however this hasn't received an update for a year and a half now, and seems forgotten. Time to move on I guess, shame, loved this app. UPDATE: Tried the official Twitter app, it's rubbish!! Now using TwitPane and it's really good.
57a094c85623ed09ac7627f8;Can't add another account Pressing "add account" results in being asked again to authorize my existing account. And round and round we go. Uninstalled.
57a094ca5623ed09ac7627f9;Very Nice Nicely organized and an easy way to get to what I'm following, quickly.
57a094ca5623ed09ac7627fa;I love that you guys provided the source code for budding coders to use.
57a094ca5623ed09ac7627fb;Love it but I would love to be able to copy the tweets or integrate translation so i can connect with foreign friends.
57a094ca5623ed09ac7627fc;Bugs...! Add account option is directed to authorise the same ac what i have sign in. 3 star to 1 star.. & Uninstalling.
57a094cd5623ed09ac7627fd;Crashed when trying to open an image Okay, but...Crashed when trying to open an image..please help
57a094cd5623ed09ac7627fe;Don't like the word limit in DM's.Would also like to rearrange the lanes instead of scrolling back and forth.
57a094cd5623ed09ac7627ff;Used to be the best Twitter client ever but since the Marshmallow upgrade it crashes everytime I click on a photo. Unfortunately the contact developer feature elicits no response and I'm now looking for a replacement. Very disappointing.
57a094cd5623ed09ac762800;Can't open images directly on MM Been using this for ages but since I moved to marshmallow crashes when I tap on images. Don't think it's going to be updated :(
57a094cf5623ed09ac762801;Can't block user or delete DM chat Please tell me how to so it. ..
57a094cf5623ed09ac762802;Need update for L
57a094cf5623ed09ac762803;Thank you Mr. Lacy Many other annoying Twitter apps out there, want money, provide ads, and just make it inconvenient to use. I have switched to yours as I no longer trust Twitter's own with access to my contacts. Thank you for the work you've done on this.
57a094cf5623ed09ac762804;Was great Since marshmallow update clicking on a picture forces close, hopefully the developer's working on it then I'll revise my review.
57a094d25623ed09ac762805;Good - except on Marshmallow I've used this as my twitter client for a long time. Works great, excepting it doesn't really work if you want to see reactions to a tweet for people that you don't follow. That doesn't work. With Android Marshmallow, the non updates to this so really show. If you click on a picture, it crashes. Maybe time to move on
57a094d25623ed09ac762806;Crashes more lately. You can't block accounts. You can't unretweet. Threading is broken.
57a094d25623ed09ac762807;Has serious battery issues I dunno if it's a runaway process or something but this app can make my phone seriously hot, even after quitting.
57a094d25623ed09ac762808;Working OK better than twitter
57a094d35623ed09ac762809;no background process
57a094d35623ed09ac76280a;No trends No list for trends.
57a094d35623ed09ac76280b;A + Thank you for your great work. Material design ?
57a094d35623ed09ac76280c;Locked up! Report says, page doesn't exit??? Been using it! WHAT? COMPLETELY GONE NOW????? Plz tell me what's going on???
57a094d55623ed09ac76280d;Like Tweet Deck. Good customizability. I didn't find an option to make the tab labels into icons. I actually hate the constantly open compose tweet taking up valuable space. Incoming long DM's are shortened into links. This would be almost perfect if those few things changed.
57a094d55623ed09ac76280e;It's great but You can't mute someone you follow or mute just one person's retweets. This is something I find really useful on Tweetcaster, which I'm not using atm because their link system is messed up after their latest update. If they fix it I'll probably go back but it would only be for these two features.
57a094d55623ed09ac76280f;Second Worst Twitter client I've ever used
57a094d55623ed09ac762810;Compact, dependable, good features
57a094d75623ed09ac762811;Nice apps All i want was here, thanks alot bro
57a094d75623ed09ac762812;Video support Overall rate is 4.2 because you guys don't support video, otherwise the rate will be higher...
57a094d75623ed09ac762813;Good, but... Like it a lot. Unfortunately it occasionally locks up and I don't know why. No other apps do that. Would rate higher if it didn't do that. Badly in need of update.
57a094d75623ed09ac762814;Upgrade the ui for 5.0 Very useful but GUI is very old.
57a094d75623ed09ac762815;Good but... Can't see replies to tweets
57a094da5623ed09ac762816;Old and dated.
57a094da5623ed09ac762817;Nice work Now it works fine I had a couple of issues with the older versions but now all of them are solved
57a094da5623ed09ac762818;Not good enough Didn't play videos, shows only one picture of a tweet that contains more than one picture.
57a094da5623ed09ac762819;Tweet Lanes Good app but a few small annoyances. It's a bit slow to load tweets however once it has it does load a lot more than other Twitter apps. Also only loads a certain number of tweets and then I have to wait for a while before I can load the rest. If these could be sorted I would rate it a 5.
57a094dc5623ed09ac76281a;Clean UI This is probably the smallest twitter client out there, and is amazing! It doesn't have all the clutter that the other apps have. It's very easy to install, login, go. Very nice if you want a simple twitter client without clutter!
57a094dc5623ed09ac76281b;Gone backwards Was good but now doesn't load all tweets, only the previous few hours. Not good when checking in morning. Unable to see videos or conversations unless u open link. Not practical
57a094dc5623ed09ac76281c;Thanks Good
57a094dc5623ed09ac76281d;Can only load 200 olds tweets Can only load the last 200 tweets. The 201 to ..... are lost. Not good for me
57a094de5623ed09ac76281e;Solid, usable app Good twitter app with all the features you'd want in an app. Like others the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that the UI is dated, but I still use it on my tablet as my primary twitter app
57a094de5623ed09ac76281f;Outdated My favourite client but it lacks support for galleries and animated gifs. Sometimes waits endlessly when loading new tweets; killing app and trying again then loads tweets normally.
57a094ee5623ed09ac762820;GARBAGE I wasn't impressed with this app at all it took entirely too long for my timeline mentions refreshing my page etc to pop up which makes this app useless to me I have to say this is the worst Twitter app I've tried so far the best I've tried was tweetcaster far as design its perfect an easy to use but it also has its problems but despite its problems it still beats out the rest of them if they ever fix those problems like lagging don't always show RTS etc tweetcaster would be by far the best Twitter app ever
57a094ee5623ed09ac762821;The apps sucks oke
57a094ee5623ed09ac762822;Almost easy to use, simple and clean--no ads. I really appreciate it :) if you add an in-app browser everything will be perfect.
57a094ef5623ed09ac762823;Love the app and have been using it for years, but it seems to be burning allot of power recently. Edit: forget it, clearing data seems to have fixed my issue
57a094ef5623ed09ac762824;Just downloaded it. So far it's not bad. May rate higher once I've used it more. 2 problems though. It takes quite a while to load after I have swiped to something and not all of my direct messages show up.
57a094ef5623ed09ac762825;The best Twitter client
57a094ef5623ed09ac762826;Nice Much better than the in house app
57a094ef5623ed09ac762827;Development has stopped
57a094f15623ed09ac762828;Would be great if it had trending. Also can't delete my tweets.
57a094f15623ed09ac762829;It's nice.
57a094f15623ed09ac76282a;Still really slow Wish they took more time on this like on action launcher has potential to be great but not enough support please get it working great
57a094f15623ed09ac76282b;Dated Works well but designed for old android, needs a reboot for Android lollipop. Can't see who else responded to posts.
57a094f35623ed09ac76282c;I like this app but why does it say you have reached the rate limit and the timeline is a little jerky needs update fix this and i will give it five stars thanks.
57a094f35623ed09ac76282d;Shiyt Can't reload tweets
57a094f35623ed09ac76282e;Looks good
57a094f35623ed09ac76282f;Eh Doesn't let you add multiple accts, like it says you can. Just crashes. The only way to contact devs is via Twitter, which they haven't used in ages!
57a094f65623ed09ac762830;I like it Wow i start love this app, can you add widget with full feature like button update, post etc. Thanks
57a094f65623ed09ac762831;is coollll aplication my favorite now
57a094f65623ed09ac762832;Images fail to open most of the time If you clear the cache often, then images generally load okay, but who wants to do that. Please fix! Otherwise a great app. This image issue became too much of a burden. Had to uninstall it and move on to the next app.
57a094f65623ed09ac762833;It's ok I like it this app, but i don't receive notifivication
57a094f85623ed09ac762834;Great app! Just missing a little something. The only thing reason I did not give this a five-star rating is because it lacks the ability to organize lanes into the order I'd like to see them. It gets a bit tedious swiping continuously to get to the lane I want. Otherwise, this is an excellent app.
57a094f85623ed09ac762835;Karim Awesome app., if there is a big widget that time 5 starts. ;)
57a094f85623ed09ac762836;Can't UN-follow Once you follow 50 people you can no longer follow or UN-follow anyone.The UN-follow button disappears. Does not show how many people starred the tweet.Missing basic functionalities but overall it's a great alternative to stock Twitter .
57a094fc5623ed09ac762837;Good & clean app; awaiting more features Would love to have advanced features such as - scheduling tweets and settings to fetch only a filtered set of tweets for a session.
57a094fc5623ed09ac762838;Good but... Really needs a "go to first (or top)" command to quickly get to the top of the timeline..
57a094fc5623ed09ac762839;Great app if it worked After a week of having it installed, suddenly it will never load any new tweets, rendering the app non functioning. Hopefully this shall be fixed.
57a094fc5623ed09ac76283a;Hate it Never works anymore.
57a0950c5623ed09ac76283b;It was best, it will remain best for users who know to configure and use it. Most extendible twitter application.
57a0950c5623ed09ac76283c;Useful, Configurable Still like this 100x more than the official client but images won't post any more
57a0950c5623ed09ac76283d;Won't upload any images. It's intuitive and functional BUT no tweets with images can be sent. Kind of a deal breaker, you know?
57a0950c5623ed09ac76283e;Does not post! The app is nice (UI wise) however does not post tweets and the compact design is too slim. Make it what it once was plz
57a0950e5623ed09ac76283f;Back on top. Can no longer use custom consumer keys. That was the defining feature of this client. Five stars again if it ever gets fixed. [EDIT]: It was fixed.
57a0950e5623ed09ac762840;Looks ok If only we could schedule tweets..I cud add you 3 stars.but its a good app
57a0950e5623ed09ac762841;Saved up a lot of storage But another request can you add notification just like the Twitter app notifies us in notification bar
57a0950e5623ed09ac762842;Can't send photos Error 400 all day. Sux, gotta uninstall and use official garbage twitter app till addressed
57a095105623ed09ac762843;WoW The app is nice and clean. It's lightweight. I like the dark theme. But want to know how to set custom notification? I.e. I want to get all notification when @c4etech tweets.
57a095105623ed09ac762844;Excellent, but It doesn't show replies (rarely and partly do) please fix this. Every account can be customized to different side color in the timeline (nice) contrary to a review I read before.
57a095105623ed09ac762845;cool but not 5/5 yet where are the group dms? i can't see them nowhere :-/ will they appear in the next update??
57a095115623ed09ac762846;Not for multiple accounts. Merges multiple accounts into one timeline and There is no way to get around that. This is ridiculous. only recommended if you have one account. seeing one timeline is impossible. App appears to be a copycat of Plume minus the ads in many ways. App is missing translate feature. Trends feature doesn't work. Interactions missing features too. it's not intuitive as well. rather complicated. not recommended
57a095115623ed09ac762847;Vote option is missed I can't vote or see vote option,please fix
57a095115623ed09ac762848;Cool twitter client
57a095135623ed09ac762849;Better than other clients, but I dread updating it Would be almost perfect if every update didn't break something. This time, images fail to load after refreshing unless I manually flush the cache
57a095135623ed09ac76284a;need a read it later function I like everything about this app but I don't want to favorite something so I can read it later. I would like a read it later function. thanks
57a095135623ed09ac76284b;Don't seem to be able to send tweets with photos in them...
57a095135623ed09ac76284c;Please make it able to upload video then it'll be perfect
57a095145623ed09ac76284d;More bugs ? Loading issue had been clear with the last update (thank you for that) but now I still cant directly shares photos or video from twidere to other app :/
57a095145623ed09ac76284e;A pretty damn good open source Twitter client. Totally toe-to-toe with commercial ones.
57a095265623ed09ac76284f;Really love the design, but I wish there was an unlock by PIN feature.
57a095265623ed09ac762850;A lot of bugs. Good but not complete If your looking for a lockscreen this app is incomplete. In fact, it notes the lockscreen feature is still in beta testing so really this app is not doing its 1 job. Example: phone unlocks automatically without swiping and can be done by just a button. Sometimes even auto unlocks when a notification comes up. For the most part this app looks promising as it's clean and minimal. However it's like a video-game you buy which needs constant DLC to make it work.
57a095265623ed09ac762851;Good Needs pin or password unlock. But great if you don't want or need that feature.
57a095285623ed09ac762852;Cannot uninstall. My settings menu crashes every time i try to disable this apps settings to uninstall it, so i can't get rid of it. I'm running stock marshmallow on a nexus 6. I've never encountered an app i could not uninstall. Users be cautious.
57a095285623ed09ac762853;Love the concept I love how this works and how clean it is but it locks my phone every time and doesn't let my fingerprint unlock it. Is there any way to fix this?
57a095285623ed09ac762854;Really really good I wish it had fingerprint to unlock
57a0952c5623ed09ac762855;Galaxy a5 There is one glitch ,when the lock of your phone is just swipe while notification display is on, capacitive touch button( recent apps and home button) on galaxy phones tends to remove it.
57a0952c5623ed09ac762856;Almost perfect The notification, when selected to be open, gets cropped on the sides for a moment. I think it's a animation incomplete when opening the notification.
57a0952c5623ed09ac762857;Cannot deactivate to uninstall I was about to uninstall this app and suddenly, it stops when I want to deactivate from administration menu to uninstall
57a0952c5623ed09ac762858;Very cool :D
57a0952f5623ed09ac762859;Over due for an upgrade. Please upgrade. Reminds me of MotoDisplay but could be better.
57a0952f5623ed09ac76285a;Sometime screen flashes Whenever i use this app,in a day screen flashes sometime when i recieve any notification. I want to use this app so please fix it.
57a0952f5623ed09ac76285b;Doesn't work Now I can't uninstall it!
57a0952f5623ed09ac76285c;I love it but please have a pin or pattern lock I read the help. Thats a bad logic. Every lock can be broken but that doesnt mean that we shouldn't have one. I wanted to donate but just then I realized you arnt building a lock at all.
57a095305623ed09ac76285d;Perfect
57a095305623ed09ac76285e;Be able to change pic It's great, I just want to be able to change the background with something else that's not black or my homescreen
57a095305623ed09ac76285f;Good. One minor issue I've found. This app makes for a good lock screen alternative. It claims to be simple and minimalistic, and it is. My only problem is that, after 5 days of having this app, Active Mode has recently stopped working. I've reinstalled the app, reset my phone, etc. Nothing has resolved it yet.
57a095305623ed09ac762860;Proximity sensor very inconsistent on the Nexus 6
57a095345623ed09ac762861;Love this app....‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
57a095345623ed09ac762862;Sexy AF Amazing locksreen. Now you can add widgets so Zooper and etc look fantastic. No finger print support tho, have to use 2 locksreens or nothing at all. PLS ADD FINGERPRINT SUPPORT :D
57a095345623ed09ac762863;Quando se aperta o botao home a tela de bloqueio some, a tela de bloqueio n√£o desaparece quando estamos em uma liga√ß√£o, e as notifica√ß√µes depois que vc v√™ elas. Elas continuam ali, n√£o desaparecendo assim que vc desbloqueia a tela. Por favor arrumem esses erros e essa tela de bloqueio sera a melhor de todas como substituta a padr√£o.
57a095375623ed09ac762864;Need direct reply from the lock screen I liked it very much. I would like to rate it five, if it have option to reply directly from the lock screen. Now I'm getting notifications to see on lock screen, but to reply it, I'm using finger print to open then responding.
57a095375623ed09ac762865;Good app Make more...patern lock..or another else...n fix lockscreen bug quickly
57a095375623ed09ac762866;Stupid. What's the point of a lockscreen if you can't have a lock on it?
57a095375623ed09ac762867;Love it I'd love it even more if it had more security options like a pattern or a PIN, but great work
57a0953a5623ed09ac762868;Stupid This app hardly ever works, and it is literally impossible for me to uninstall it.
57a0953a5623ed09ac762869;Note 5 I messed with it I did few things wrong it works very well for what it is next update change the colors on the clock font five stars for sure the next update
57a0953a5623ed09ac76286a;Cuts my alarm off? My alarm only goes for a split second then ACDisplay turns it off? I've checked every setting and can't get it fixed. Please help.
57a0953a5623ed09ac76286b;Nice A lot of lock screens claim to be minimalistic but this one does it for real. Using Nokia X2 and will love support for music widget.
57a0953e5623ed09ac76286c;High-five! Simple and reliable. Thanks!
57a0953e5623ed09ac76286d;Almost perfect 1) The following feature is called active display, it was integrated first into a Nokia 909, later introduced into a few Lumia Whidows Phone devices. 2) On windows phones (that the following feature was available on), it was labelled as "Glance screen" and it was separate from the lock screen 3) Glance is essentially an extra layer over the current screen lock layer. 4) I tried most of the alternative apps, yet I come back to this one all the time 5) GET IT NOW!
57a0953e5623ed09ac76286e;No replacement of this app found till date, but no updates! "EXACTLY", mark my word, "exactly" what I was looking for and still no replacement found after using for more than 1 year. But no updates since a long time.
57a0954b5623ed09ac76286f;Beautiful!! In love with this app .... It would be just amazing If it won't drain out too much battery and itd be crazy if this has a pattern lock (i really hope) and a custom wallpaper would be fab so ...can we see them ? This app basically deserves first place and the most downloaded app In the market under customisation!!!! Hopefully this app gets even more better with lots of cool stuff !!!!!, ,
57a0954b5623ed09ac762870;Bug in marshmallow The lock screen keeps coming up in recent menu. Please fix it
57a0954b5623ed09ac762871;Sucks Impossible to delete.
57a0954f5623ed09ac762872;Good Remove the ac in the notification bar its useless... And improve that lock screen, i always have to turn it on and off because it stop working... Other than that, awesome! 5 stars when fixed!
57a0954f5623ed09ac762873;Really? You have to jump through hoops to disable and uninstall this app. Not okay.
57a0954f5623ed09ac762874;Efficient and straight to the point Perfect for people who love clean design and hate cluttered notifications. Would be better if there was a password, option to use a photo as background, and option to open more apps (instead of just dialer and camera) when swiping from the corners. And I wish the clock didn't go away when a widget is used. Looking forward to more features and updates!
57a095515623ed09ac762875;Awesome‚ò∫‚ò∫üòäüéÇ
57a095515623ed09ac762876;Love it Ign 10/10
57a095555623ed09ac762877;Great but lack of pin/pattern Great development. I m loving this app but lack of lock screen makes this app vulnerable to undesired activity. Pls ad a lock screen option.
57a095555623ed09ac762878;I can't delete it It won't get off my phone!
57a095555623ed09ac762879;Cool as heck, however... ...it doesn't 'really' act as a lock screen. Pressing the home button on my A8 unlocks the phone. I should have to swipe, as an accidental press with unintentionally unlock the phone. Other than that it's people the best out there.
57a095555623ed09ac76287a;Pretty good I love this, it's useful & simple. Only I'd like it if it's was just like a lock screen and not be able to exit the app...
57a095585623ed09ac76287b;Widgets Widgets needs work otherwise great lockscreen replacement
57a095585623ed09ac76287c;Classy I think, it's the finest app in my phone
57a095585623ed09ac76287d;Please release new version Save your power button, no need to press power button or volume keys to wake device. Must have app. With frequent updates
57a095585623ed09ac76287e;Drains battery very fast Real battery draining. 50% from full charge in a few hours when phone was idle!
57a0955b5623ed09ac76287f;Not even working on my phone and cant be uninstalled even if i deactivated everything in the settings. THANK YOU for this trash App. Deserves negative rating and a negative comment.
57a0955b5623ed09ac762880;Tim Can't uninstall
57a0955b5623ed09ac762881;Awesome but lacks lock screen
57a0955b5623ed09ac762882;Simple and stylish! I really love this app! Huawei's default lockscreen is terrible and MS Next is not good either. I like the UI and it's simpleness: clock, camera, dialer, notifications and music controller, that's all what I require from a lock screen :)
57a0955d5623ed09ac762883;Great and better than ambient display! This app is great!... No hit to the battery... Works great on my note 5, lg v10 and Sony z3v... Very impressive...BUT please make this work with my Nexus 6p finger scanner!
57a0955d5623ed09ac762884;Love it Awesome just needs its own wallpaper
57a0955d5623ed09ac762885;You should add a password for unlock.
57a0955d5623ed09ac762886;On Point Exactly what I've been needing..
57a0955d5623ed09ac762887;It would be best if you could make unlock with fingerprint and / or 4 digit pass code
57a095775623ed09ac762888;Great app But....when a app is open while the AC display is activated as lock screen..the screen goes on off repeatedly......showing the opened app and ac display lock screen....
57a095775623ed09ac762889;You have click on notifications to see whats in them. Even in the video when they say "you can see all your notifications" the screen actually just shows the time and the icon from the app that made the notification there's nothing to read or see. I'm not sure why they have a features like "wake up on notification" or wake using proximity sensor because you still have to tap on each individual notification to see it.
57a095775623ed09ac76288a;Force???? Isn't uninstalling !!! No passcodes too
57a095795623ed09ac76288b;Pandora doesn't refresh when song changes
57a095795623ed09ac76288c;Battery life Has anyone else noticed the battery draining faster since installing this app?
57a095795623ed09ac76288d;Can not uninstall???? I used it for a while and it was very helpful but now it's integrated inside my oneplus 2 and I wanted to uninstall it but I can't. Coz I can not remove it from device administration. Everytime I touch the tick. It takes me back to settings and I can do nothing about it.. So this app is permanently stuck on my phone
57a0957d5623ed09ac76288e;Troubleshooting- can't deactivate once activated I have trouble with removing this app please fix. I need to deactivate it first, but when I want to deactivate it from settings&gt;lock screen and security&gt;device administrators&gt;Ac display, it always crashes. I already tried restarting my phone (Samsung S7)
57a0957d5623ed09ac76288f;Love it but needs security... It's a great lock screen, but I hate that it doesn't have a capablity to enable a pass code. I'd really appreciate it if the developer(s) can make this option available and keep its material style and functionality.
57a095815623ed09ac762890;Pretty good... But... It's pretty good, like its minimalistic, and it's pretty easy to use. Although I would like if you would remove that annoying service tab on the notification bar, and add an ACTUAL security for the lockscreen.
57a095815623ed09ac762891;I love the app but? The issues I'm having on my note 5 is tht it's not working when I take it out of my pocket. Im also having a issue when I charge my phone it gets all glitchy.
57a095815623ed09ac762892;Battery sucker !!! Before sleep my phone was 99% at 11:30pm, after i woke up at 5:00am it's 85%... It happened with my phone for the first time
57a095815623ed09ac762893;Works well
57a095825623ed09ac762894;Very useful What a great app very useful I would recommend this to all people
57a095825623ed09ac762895;Always on Love this app! I've been using it for ages. Please add functionality for "always on" clock for amoled displays!
57a095825623ed09ac762896;Bom Se tivesse senha com pin ficaria exelente
57a095825623ed09ac762897;The best out there The Music widget has stopped working for roughly 3 weeks now. Play pause skip etc don't work when pressed.
57a095825623ed09ac762898;it's really doin what i want moreover it is more like motorolla lock screen.. i like it
57a095865623ed09ac762899;One of the Must Haves This app is so useful, I don't know how I lived without it before I used it. I can easily just see all my notifications without unlocking my screen with its minimalistic design.
57a095865623ed09ac76289a;Great It's a very good app; love it but it needs a password option and it will be perfect.
57a095865623ed09ac76289b;Unlock animation I have never liked that unlock style. At least can you add fully transparent color selection? Beside that this is a good minimalistic lockscreen.
57a095865623ed09ac76289c;Good I'm using galaxy note4 in marshmallow version and when I'm pulling out the pen to write quick note the ACdislay crashes down..I think we need a new update ... thank you
57a0958b5623ed09ac76289d;Great so far. The lock screen is so beautifully simplistic and so far it's been working great. Only one issue: I have the app set to stay enabled even when there are no notifications, but every so often I'll wake the phone screen and it just gets right into my phone. The lock screen isn't there. So just that one issue. Something I'd really like to see is the ability to set some sort of security to the lock screen, whether it's a password, pin number, or pattern.
57a0958b5623ed09ac76289e;One feature short! Please add a security feature, currently i would have to go through 2 lockscreens.
57a0958d5623ed09ac76289f;Update it Motion pretty much doesn't work at all on my moto x 2014
57a0958d5623ed09ac7628a0;Pretty good Doesn't seem to work seamlessly with lockscreen. I have to swipe once on acdisplay and then once on system lockscreen. 5 star if you fix this!
57a0958d5623ed09ac7628a1;Nice! It's flawless
57a0958d5623ed09ac7628a2;Awesome Really love it looks beautiful, it would be perfect if I can put a pattern or pin with the app instead of the built in lock but it's still great
57a095905623ed09ac7628a3;Add support for fingerprint As tody all phones have fingerprint reader so add support to read fingerprint.
57a095905623ed09ac7628a4;Amazing Should also have lockscreen password security :)
57a095905623ed09ac7628a5;It's good but... I didn't like the notification that never goes away and also I can't double tap to wake for some reason. For these reasons I'm just going back to stock lockscreen.
57a095905623ed09ac7628a6;Good After last night circle animation not working please fix these problem and add some security please do fast
57a095925623ed09ac7628a7;Cleanest and Simplest Lock Screen but... Hands down one of the best cleanest and simplest lock screens out there. But it needs a security option (ex. PIN unlock or PASSWORD). Hopefully that feature would be added in.
57a095925623ed09ac7628a8;Simply awesome!!! I love the app. Its a must try. Its only downside is that it has NO lockscreen with code, pattern or password. But otherwise its a great app.
57a095925623ed09ac7628a9;Nice app but ... I cannot deactivate it as it occupies large memory on ram ... How to deactivate it ?help plz
57a095925623ed09ac7628aa;my app its totally loving app using it about 3 years
57a095955623ed09ac7628ab;Can you make it more privacy? Its already been a good experience so far. But, i just wanna make it privacy with locksreen locked, you can make it, cant you?
57a095955623ed09ac7628ac;No updates! This app definitely has potential! but there's no consistent development. I really enjoy this app for the most part, but you can tell there are bugs that need to be addressed. Why not update your app and turn it into a real money maker! I would pay if this app was keep updated.. Just so you know, thanks
57a095955623ed09ac7628ad;Good üëç
57a095955623ed09ac7628ae;Lockscreen Beta feature & the last update was a Year ago..........sheeeeesh!
57a095985623ed09ac7628af;Good
57a095985623ed09ac7628b0;Crashes Cannot even launch the app on my LG G Pro. Please fix it.. I loved this app
57a095985623ed09ac7628b1;Absolutely love almost everything about it. Only thing that I would like changed is for the lockscreen to not disable when the phone does actions while the screen is off(such as the music player starting or receiving a phone call).
57a095985623ed09ac7628b2;Best notification displaying app available. I'd like to see the lock screen feature work with fingerprint reader supported devices like the Nexus 6p, etc.
57a0959b5623ed09ac7628b3;Can't uninstall I cannot uninstall this app from my phone. It's so frustrating please help
57a0959b5623ed09ac7628b4;Awesome Everything you could ask for
57a0959b5623ed09ac7628b5;Love it Cant believe the developer made an ad-free software. The app explains everything leaving no doubt. Works great with Android. Will donate at least one ice cream within the next few days if it keeps the great job!
57a0959b5623ed09ac7628b6;Take a bow! The best lockscreen tested so far, and will continue to use in future. just the option to swipe from bottom corner kinda conflicts with soft keys. Will there be update with custom clock widgets or app in built widgets?! ;)
57a0959e5623ed09ac7628b7;I like the simplistic looks And pls remove that notice on the staus bar. Its irritating me
57a0959e5623ed09ac7628b8;It doesn't matter! Love the app, but the ability to set it as a lock screen is meant to be secure, no matter if the pin or password options are easy to bypass, a lock is a lock screen. If there is no security it's just a screen.
57a0959e5623ed09ac7628b9;AC display Latest update has issues with music controls showing up on lock screen.
57a0959e5623ed09ac7628ba;Useful I love the simplicity, but I wish there was a pin lock for it.
57a0959e5623ed09ac7628bb;Home button
57a095a15623ed09ac7628bc;It was the best Ambient display app Lack of development. Other apps, like Glance Plus, are on continuous development and became better always on app option.
57a095a15623ed09ac7628bd;Some apps not supported Contact photos in Google Messenger not displayed, among other apps. Great design though. Will remain on my lock screen in hopes more apps get support
57a095a15623ed09ac7628be;Very good Excellent
57a095a15623ed09ac7628bf;Needs a bit improvement in the lock screen There is a bug when I lock the screen the screen locking sound comes six times please improve it. Then I will rate five stars

57a095a75623ed09ac7628c4;The Clock disappear sometimes please fix this All what I can to say is thank you ho made this App.. LOVED IT SOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!
57a095a85623ed09ac7628c5;If only always on option is enabled
57a095a85623ed09ac7628c6;Everything is great except Lock screen mod. So far so good. But I'd love it if the lock screen mode is not a beta content anymore.
57a095ac5623ed09ac7628c7;Awesome! Best lock screen app ever. Don't y'all think?
57a095ac5623ed09ac7628c8;Favorite lockscreen for a long time I do wish you could set a custom background, though.
57a095ac5623ed09ac7628c9;Improvements Please add a way to lock the screen with a fingerprint or password(PIN) and also remove the notification thats says "Ac display service active". Otherwise great app !
57a095ac5623ed09ac7628ca;Needs password locking
57a095ae5623ed09ac7628cb;Please add more!!!üòÄ This app is fantastic already but it needs something more, it needs more option of hanging the wallpaper of the lock screen. Not just homescreen's or a black wall but maybe from gallery??
57a095ae5623ed09ac7628cc;Boring
57a095ae5623ed09ac7628cd;Love the minimalistic design The only thing that doesn't work are the controls for the music player. I don't know if it's because I use poweramp or it's a setting in poweramp. Other than that, it's perfect
57a095ae5623ed09ac7628ce;Modern beauty I just love it. Definitely my style.

57a095b05623ed09ac7628d3;Please Update this version, & Add More System!
57a095b35623ed09ac7628d4;Suggestion That app is great, really. But the fact that does not have PIN lock is not so good, because does not have security at all. 5 star when you put this option! Great job!!
57a095b35623ed09ac7628d5;Cool appüòÇüòÇüòÇ Designs very good its just so cool
57a095b35623ed09ac7628d6;Classy - but not secure Battery friendly and simple. This is ideal if you're looking to keep your phone looking light and modern. Kudos to the devs. Edit : Hope the devs will address this problem. As of late the Lock screen doesn't turn off if I get a notification. I've set it to turn off five seconds after I get a notification but it doesn't. It will show the display and time without switching off which can be quite annoying when youre in bed and get a notification that makes the display light up all night.
57a095b95623ed09ac7628d7;It's great.. but It would be better of there would be an option to start the app on boot cuz once I reboot into my OS... it takes about a minute or 2 for ac display to start up again. otherwise... no issues üòä
57a095b95623ed09ac7628d8;Excellent Only stopped using it because i needed stock widgets but otherwise, flawless.
57a095b95623ed09ac7628d9;Where's the admin Man u admin... Iv been using the app fr almst a yr... that's a pretty wrk dude.. loved it..if u can make it wd secured lock screen wud b grt..even thou its worth 5 star dude
57a095b95623ed09ac7628da;The Best Way for Screen Locking Yes , you guys have made an awesome app and it deserves to be given 5 star.All we need is more customization options
57a095bc5623ed09ac7628db;Love love love I would only change one thing - the constant presence of the notification bar saying that the app is active.
57a095bc5623ed09ac7628dc;Great! But not able to use lockscreen feature on Android 6 I'm not able to use the lockscreen feature. It asks for usage stats permission. But i dont know how to give that.
57a095bc5623ed09ac7628dd;Nice design and concept. Unfortunately on my Nexus 6P with 6.0 it doesn't work as a lock screen. The device still goes to the native/stock lock screen after getting past AcDisplay lock screen. Can anything be done about this?
57a095bc5623ed09ac7628de;Nice app Please add pattern or pin protection as well. That's all I'm missing. Nice UI although. üëç but add security please.
57a095bf5623ed09ac7628df;Excelent app ! i use it as my lockscreen, i would give u 5 stars if the Home button (hardware) doesnt close AcDisplay
57a095bf5623ed09ac7628e0;Can not even Uninstall it ... I tried to uncheck it from administrator but it freezes my phone and stop the setting
57a095bf5623ed09ac7628e1;How to uninstall this freaking app
57a095bf5623ed09ac7628e2;Ughhh It wont let me delete it i hate this app and it wont let me delete it it takes up so much storage and it wont even let me delete it ugh
57a095c25623ed09ac7628e3;Could had been 5 stars I would had rated this 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I can't put in a custom widget (which was probably the main reason why I was excited for this app). I was able to have it actually work once, but it was also the last. It could had been better if it had its own passcode options. It's such a disappointment that I don't see any solutions yet.
57a095c25623ed09ac7628e4;Worth it. Epic locksreen ever!

57a095c45623ed09ac7628e8;Great app, needs a little work Overall great app. On my Samsung Note 3, after upgrading to Android 5.0, giving problems when I plug in earphones and using the note function.
57a095c45623ed09ac7628e9;It won't uninstall I hate it
57a095c45623ed09ac7628ea;Good stuff!! I like this app!! Simple and quite awesome really! So easy to use and it's pretty convenient!
57a095c45623ed09ac7628eb;Minimalistic
57a095c85623ed09ac7628ec;Amazing.... But It really needs to get a pass code option for the lock screen option but other than that is an amazing app

57a095c85623ed09ac7628ee;Good app BUT.. It dosent turn on when i pick up my phone from the table or just when i lift it up a bit.. its just not responsive but works fine of i took it out of my pocket. Whats the reason?

57a095d65623ed09ac762900;Very good User interference is very good but I get active screen very few times when I shake my phone very hardly
57a095d65623ed09ac762901;The best Lock Screen & AOD replacement if only it worked better Great app! Please enable a feature of enabling pin when activated lock screen, and please have an always on screen feature as this is the best I've seen out there. This is perfect for OLED displays!
57a095d65623ed09ac762902;Amazing. Please try to enable ANALOG CLOCK and remove acdisplay services bar from notification panel. Please enable an option for analog clock also with Digital clock in the lock screen and Remove AcDisplay Services bar from notifiactions panel.
57a095da5623ed09ac762903;Best and most minimalistic lockscreen But I would love to be able to set a separate lockscreen wallpaper, instead of the home screen one I use. Also sometimes the app crashes and unless I kill and start the process again the notifications are not shown after that.
57a095da5623ed09ac762904;Integrate fingerprint security and it'll be perfect
57a095da5623ed09ac762905;I like the app, but It brings up the "use fingerprint because security policy" thing sometimes. If you can get it to turn the screen off by root or something (or however you can fix this) 5 stars

57a095de5623ed09ac76290c;Worth 5 star if it had security option. Should add an option for password so it can be used as a replacement for lockscreen. Would be really awesome if it had that. Other than that it's a super application.
57a095de5623ed09ac76290d;Nailed it! This app also allows you to use "OK Google" without having your phone plugged in, or screen unlocked! Fastest quick draw ever. üòÅ
57a095de5623ed09ac76290e;Useful . Like Moto Useful app to have and does a good job. There haven't been any updates for long .Finger print integration would be great

57a095df5623ed09ac762910;Very good app but one problem... Best lock screen out there. Its simple and looks good.. but please add a security feature. I'm pretty sure if u add a lot of people will appreciate it
57a095df5623ed09ac762911;Best but need to improve Lock screen wallpaper and weather forecasts
57a095eb5623ed09ac762912;Better sensor recognition I used this app a long time ago on my LG G2 back in the day, but I re-downloaded it for my Note 4 which is running Marshmallow - and, while I like it's use for Active Display, I believe it needs to be updated with more sensitive sensor recognition so that if I reach for my phone or pick it up to look at it, it responds by waking the display. I also want to see an update for fingerprint recognition to unlock the lockscreen because it defeats the purpose of having two lockscreens active to enter homescreen.
57a095eb5623ed09ac762913;Worst app dont install I installed it and it became device administrator. Now there is no way to uninstall it. It sucks... hangs my phone...worst app...
57a095eb5623ed09ac762914;Good alternative to Moto display
57a095f05623ed09ac762915;Best I have seen
57a095f05623ed09ac762916;Please add calender and weather integration
57a095f25623ed09ac762917;Great potential ! Some minor improvements and this app will be a must have on every device.
57a095f25623ed09ac762918;Awesome display love it ever common friends must download it
57a095f25623ed09ac762919;Great one! Use it especially for the lockscreen functionality. Could you make it possible to choose a custom wallpaper? Also, could you make an option to pin the last notification (so that one can see the most recent "news")? Thanks & and keep up the good work. Would be happy if you continue to improve your precious app.
57a095f25623ed09ac76291a;Great app but... Issues on m8 lollipop

57a095f65623ed09ac76291e;Amazing Honestly i love this app im not thr person to give a good review when the apps bad but this apps flawless i wont ever change it my favorite part is that its so simplistic never gliches out and its reliable best lockscreen app for android hands down
57a095f65623ed09ac76291f;This is exactly what I wanted! It's intuitive, minimalistic & simple. Thanks!

57a095fc5623ed09ac762926;Awesome Its an amazing lockscreen, just needs some updating.
57a096005623ed09ac762927;Lovely app but... This app has such great potential I hope the developer isn't dumping it. Apps like "Glance Plus" is taking over but aesthetically can't compare to this, functionality wise the former has unique options like direct unlock with finger print, auto disable when call alert, the gesture wake seems more sensitive too. Would be great to see features like these on ACdisplay cos this app is well written. I think a lot of people don't mind paying for good written apps.
57a096005623ed09ac762928;Impossible Uninstall Incredibly hard to uninstall and didn't really work as a lock screen.
57a096035623ed09ac762929;Actually not a bad lock screen app, but once installed, you must remove AcDisplay as an administrator before you can uninstall it. It took me a little while to figure this out, until I did, it was like Zombie apocalypse, the thing just kept reappearing. Seems like something nefarious was going on, no other lock screen requires administrator privileges. I might try the app again and see if it will function if I don't give it admin rights, but this thing scares me a bit.
57a096035623ed09ac76292a;Good but I'm having a serious issue ! Whenever I try to deactivate the device admin for this app, the setting page reopens and it never gets unchecked ! Please help, I can't uninstall the app !!! ...... I've an oneplus x.
57a096065623ed09ac76292b;Only problem is with devices with fingerprint unlock. If I get a notification, and I try to unlock with fingerprint, it accepts the fingerprint then afterwards I still need to enter backup unlock code like PIN or password to unlock the phone.
57a096065623ed09ac76292c;Amazing App
57a096065623ed09ac76292d;Fantastic
57a096065623ed09ac76292e;Fingerprint Please make it intergrated with fingerprint lock. Note 5

57a0960a5623ed09ac762930;So good Id liked this to much and pls add some security like pass,patterns or pin to make it 5 Good Job!
57a0960a5623ed09ac762931;Need full string password protection. Very good and simple lock screen which is very light and functional. Cant really call this as a lock screen as it does'nt has a password protection. It will be the best screen lock on android platform if full string password and (or) finger print protection with privacy control(ability to define apps that could be unlocked with out password) is added to this... Expecting new essential feature soon...
57a096115623ed09ac762932;Please Tell me what to do It tells me to activate the notificafion permission,then it takes me to the notification center,where the notification permission is already active.I get back into the app,it tells me that the notification permission is not active.What can I do?
57a096115623ed09ac762933;SIMPLE AND FAST BUT NO LOCK PATTERNS OR PINS BUT OVERALL ITS GREAT!üëç
57a096115623ed09ac762934;Doesn't allow you to actually lock your phone I didnt think that there is a lockscreen app that doesn't actually allow you to lock your device (in the sense of requiring a password or pattern to access it), but this is unfortunately one.
57a096145623ed09ac762935;Falta um controle de m√≠dia Dei 4 estrelas por que poderia ter um controle de m√≠dia nele, pra controlar m√∫sicas que est√£o sendo tocadas
57a096145623ed09ac762936;Good idea, but not a lockscreen The lockscreen mode doesn't have any security pattern built in... So it is just not possible to use this app as is as it doesn't perform the basic function it should.
57a096185623ed09ac762937;Very good, but a work in progress. The settings and features in AcDisplay are adequate, or more than enough for many users. However, the lockscreen beta feature needs a lot of work (I've sent an email regarding some possible fixes). The app itself is basic, and allows everyone to get the most out of it, while it's functions are very aesthetically pleasing. Also, there is a very short delay between the lock screen activating and the screen turning off, which might be noticed by a few people, although most wouldn't figure it out very quickly.
57a096185623ed09ac762938;Shutting down This app keeps shutting down my phone once I set it down, fix this bug and I give it 5 stars it's really good, without that problem
57a0961c5623ed09ac762939;(LG G3 D855) Everything is perfect except one major issue. After I receive a phone call, the AcDisplay lockscreen unlocks the phone and not putting the phone back to lock state itself. When it's in my pocket, after a missed call, apps are opened by accidental touches because of the phone is unlocked. This is so annoying and please fix this big issue asap.
57a0961c5623ed09ac76293a;Notification not working It was working fine full some time back, but now I can't view the notifications on my lock screen. Don't know what's the issue. Please help
57a0961c5623ed09ac76293b;Love it Please add option to mod clock üòÉ
57a0961c5623ed09ac76293c;Its wonderful!!! all features are good. The lock screen is pretty simpler . The wave to unlock feature is useful and wonderful
57a096215623ed09ac76293d;Parasitic Would not uninstall
57a096215623ed09ac76293e;Never again.! I download it. And i can't Uninstall it. I went all the way through the setting. Still can't disable or Uninstall. Not recommended.
57a096275623ed09ac76293f;HELP!!!! I am trying to delete this app off of my galaxy s5 and it keeps saying "this is a device administrater, you must deactivate first" it's deactivated and it still won't let me Uninstaller please help!!!
57a096275623ed09ac762940;Not reliable Sometimes works, most of the times does not. I have rooted Android 6 and with xposed module with all permissions but still doesn't work well.
57a096275623ed09ac762941;Moto's display lacks the looks when it comes to this This is a great little handy app, the only problem I'm facing is the wave to wake feature, it isn't working properly for me, hope this issue is looked into for the next few updates
57a0962a5623ed09ac762942;Do Not Download! You've Been Warned! This application has attached it's self to my phone and I'm unable to remove it! I've reached out to the developers for help on how to remove the admin rights and no one has responded. I have turned off all of it's functions but when you attempt to remove the admin for the application it freezes the crashes the setting! I am reaching out to Google for assistance since I belive this app is pure spam! Galaxy Note 5.
57a0962a5623ed09ac762943;Except that the plus button in the widgets tab doesn't work That is all. Loved it as a glance screen-like addition for Android
57a0962e5623ed09ac762944;Best! Although i loved the app as it is the most simplistic lockscreen but please fix two things. First the notification of active mode in the notification panel which is highly irritating and please, please add your custom pattern lock it would be perfect then.
57a0962e5623ed09ac762945;Dev seems to be dead Interferes with nexus imprint, Add portrait support for pixel c
57a0962e5623ed09ac762946;On Marshmallow, the screen is buggy and sometimes shows the notification shade.
57a0962e5623ed09ac762947;Add Security It is a very simple and classic app but if asecuroty option of patterns amd pins is provided then it would be a classic replacement for actual lockscreen. It is only missing one star because of this.
57a0962f5623ed09ac762948;Uses 20 MB of RAM like WTF
57a0962f5623ed09ac762949;Love it ‚ô• It is very usefull
57a0962f5623ed09ac76294a;Very nice
57a0962f5623ed09ac76294b;Requested feature Please add some sort of pin lock to the lockscreen
57a0962f5623ed09ac76294c;Does not have active display i Dies not have always on display feature
57a096315623ed09ac76294d;Poor Security lock is missing like as pattern and pin
57a096315623ed09ac76294e;Really? 1 star for the worst way to uninstall an app. Ever.
57a096315623ed09ac76294f;Update Why do not u update such a nice app.
57a096315623ed09ac762950;Thank you
57a096315623ed09ac762951;Simple Does what it say. No frills. But needs password feature.
57a096345623ed09ac762952;Unfortunately unable to uninstall.Go to Settings &gt; Security &gt; Device Administrators and uncheck AcDisplay. You can now uninstall AcDisplay normally
57a096345623ed09ac762953;Please put in a pattern lock or any security feature. I love this interface but it can't replace my stock lock.
57a096345623ed09ac762954;Loved it This is the best lockscreen notification application i have ever seen . Hope to see much more üòä
57a096345623ed09ac762955;Add an Always On feature It would be so great if you added an always on feature just like in S7 and LG phones. Would give 5 stars üòâ
57a096385623ed09ac762956;Nice I wish you could bring more updates like 3rd oarty widget support in bigger size
57a096385623ed09ac762957;Notification panel stays down after waking up the phone! Its like i pull down the notification panel and i lock the phone...and when i unlock it the notification panel still stays as it is.... down on the lockscreen! Which actually negates the base of a lockscreen whatsoever! Fix this issue anyhow!
57a096385623ed09ac762958;When a call comes in, the phone does not wake up from lookscreen, thus it's impossible to know who is calling. also, any reason why the last update was in july 2015. the developer abandoned this app??
57a0963a5623ed09ac762959;Needs passcode I REALLY like it. The only problem it has is it has no passcode. That is a deal breaker for me. If it gets one then I'll give it 5 stars. Great lockscreen otherwise though!
57a0963a5623ed09ac76295a;Can't uninstall üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò† App didn't work now I can't uninstall it!!! WTH!
57a0963a5623ed09ac76295b;What stoner thought of this? Horrible.
57a0963a5623ed09ac76295c;It could be better... It would be good if I can change the position of the clock!
57a0963a5623ed09ac76295d;Virus It's a virus. Once you install it it will never get Uninstalled forum your device until you reset it. Useless.
57a0963c5623ed09ac76295e;Not Working Not working on miui7. waiting for fix soon
57a0963c5623ed09ac76295f;Why don't you give security features? Otherwise it's really good
57a0963c5623ed09ac762960;I love that this is so minimal. I've been looking for a lock screen like this for ages however it needs PIN entry to be great.
57a0963c5623ed09ac762961;Good but....... In samsung devices (note 5 ) when the display turns on the buttons light up.Pls remove it.
57a0963c5623ed09ac762962;Simply the best
57a096445623ed09ac762963;Good but can be better Although this app is great, but still it has some things that need to be fixed, like messages not opening the application. If this is fixed it will win hands down.
57a096445623ed09ac762964;Thank you for the free app that working so well. It is awesome.üòÜ.4 stars given.
57a096445623ed09ac762965;Crappie app You cannot uninstall it.
57a096445623ed09ac762966;Just one thing... Add some security like adding password/pin/pattern options to it. I swear I'll leave my stock lockscreen forever, it's that awesome.
57a096495623ed09ac762967;Very Good but, Nice app but pressing home button wud take directly to the home screen without unlocking through this app.
57a096495623ed09ac762968;nice
57a096495623ed09ac762969;If there's Fingerprint authorization, would have rate 5 star. Pls update.
57a096495623ed09ac76296a;Well done so far It is a nice app overall but cmon "there is no secure lock on Android blah blah blah " no one cares about that Mr. Developer , its a lockscreen, LOCKSCREEN so if there's no lock what's the purpose?? I'm not worried about people bypassing the lock , I ain't got crap on it anyways , I just need to lock pesky people out -_-
57a0964c5623ed09ac76296b;Cannot unistall Why does this ap doesn't allow to be uninstalled, how is s possible? I decide what i want and i don't like this app thus want to delete why has the uninstall button bernt deactivated
57a0964c5623ed09ac76296c;Awesome The design is literally inspiring and the code is so organised. This inspired me to make my own minimal lockscreen. Thank you AChep :)
57a0964c5623ed09ac76296d;LOCKscreen It would be awesome if you put a security lock passcode or something on it.
57a0964c5623ed09ac76296e;Pretty amazing
57a0964e5623ed09ac76296f;Just Perfect amazing app Thanks
57a0964e5623ed09ac762970;Awww I tried to give the timeout policy permissions but the app keeps crashing the settings. So bummed. Favorite app for sure.
57a0964e5623ed09ac762971;Suggestions since there are lockscreen feature, why dont you add password feature for support that lockscreen? btw. this is cool apps.. i like it
57a0964e5623ed09ac762972;It's awesome Really liked it. It's simple and really useful
57a0964e5623ed09ac762973;Please add more features. I will give five stars if you add more features in this app
57a096505623ed09ac762974;How do you take this stupid app off my phone
57a096505623ed09ac762975;Its nice but i wish the wallpaper could be change with that it will be awesome
57a096505623ed09ac762976;Good, not perfect though I like the app a lot, but the widgets don't seem to consistently work
57a096505623ed09ac762977;Awesome!
57a096505623ed09ac762978;Not working I have a note 5 with Android 6.0.1 update. I recently found out about this app and tried it out but it doesn't activate. I don't know what to do and theirs no option to turn on the app
57a096545623ed09ac762979;So far so good Responsive and also great for lockscreen too.
57a096545623ed09ac76297a;Sumtyms apps doesn't work...it has alot of bugs.... No update 4 a long time..... Stil it has bugs... Fix it soon.....
57a096545623ed09ac76297b;this program this program so bad she does not removed from any phone
57a096545623ed09ac76297c;This app is completely terrible All it does is slows down my phone and I can't delete it ever since I got this app my phone has ran 10x slower and that will never change now
57a096545623ed09ac76297d;For an older version
57a096565623ed09ac76297e;Completely useless. I can't even deactivate it
57a096565623ed09ac76297f;Loved it Dude really loved it, but missing security feature, pls look after it
57a096565623ed09ac762980;Bekar It can't be removed or uninstall bekar worst app ever
57a096565623ed09ac762981;Very helpful üòôüòôüòôüòô
57a096565623ed09ac762982;Cold be "The best" On ZenFone 4, loving it... just one thing irritates: constant notification of AcDisplay services... remove that and it can be simply the best!
57a0965d5623ed09ac762983;Beautiful The title say it all
57a0965d5623ed09ac762984;Nice app Could you make wave to wake a little more sensitive it never wakes from a wave for me also could you add a pickup gesture to wake
57a0965d5623ed09ac762985;Need a lill bit upgrade I thin if you guys bring out of the system or a lock system as pattern or password or pin it would be better to maintain the security system I didn't found any lock or any security system on it so please guys do this update
57a0965d5623ed09ac762986;Awsome app Great and handy app to read notification without opening the lock screen... Plz control battery drain
57a096615623ed09ac762987;Better app This is a good app but need some improve and an update .
57a096615623ed09ac762988;Active display not working. The active display is not working otherwise it's a great app.
57a096615623ed09ac762989;Bug Fix Bien Se han arreglado los bugs me gusta ^^
57a096615623ed09ac76298a;Just need one thing The app is amazing and works better than the Moto display, in my opinion! But there's a thing that really need to be fix: in Android 5.0 or 6.0, when we unlock the Acdisplay, we have to swipe up the Android lock screen again to show pattern lock screen.
57a0966b5623ed09ac76298b;Simply elegant For it's minimalist style, it's still quite functional. Love the sophistication.
57a0966b5623ed09ac76298c;White screen Why do I see for a second a pinkish white screen when I swipe to my home screen on my G4? It's quite annoying
57a0966b5623ed09ac76298d;Excellent Just needs a better media navigation panel and the ability to view persistent notifications. Ie a flashlight notification so I can switch it off without unlocking the phone.
57a0966b5623ed09ac76298e;I love it but, when I get notifications from facebook messenger, the messenger chat head is showing up over the lockscreen, so it's pretty much useless. Fix it and 5 stars
57a0966f5623ed09ac76298f;Good, but lacks features It's very sleek but it's missing a lot of functionality such as the ability to see a call or being able to have a different wallpaper than your home screen.
57a0966f5623ed09ac762990;Not 5 star Not 5 stars as I believe it should provide option for basic authentication at least say a password or pattern. Otherwise a cool and good app
57a0966f5623ed09ac762991;How to remove this app plz help me
57a0966f5623ed09ac762992;Great app but it comes on when on a call.
57a0966f5623ed09ac762993;shite how dyou delete it because i cant get rid of it now
57a096725623ed09ac762994;This is the best lock screen I've ever used. It's pretty customizable and works simply and sensibly. I refused to use any other
57a096725623ed09ac762995;Almost perfect if I add widget the time and battery percentage was gone only the chosen widget will appear. My phone is 4.2.2 Android version.
57a096725623ed09ac762996;No password unlock
57a096725623ed09ac762997;Simple but very useful I would like to have option to disable app when charging, in order to use other battery lock screen, thanks so much!
57a0967e5623ed09ac762998;Background Can you make background setting light or dark.(i mean too dark of wallpaper)
57a0967e5623ed09ac762999;Please fix this Love the app but why can i should i have to sacrifice the clock and other basic lock screen items for a widget wgy cant i have the clock displayed and the widget below it. And there is a glitch or maybe its purposely if u double press the home key (i guess it works only in phones with a solid home key like samsung not the touch) your this will bypass the ac display.i.e. if no security is enabled (e.g.pattern) u can unlock your phone by double pressing the home key instead of swiping
57a096825623ed09ac76299a;Waiting for Nexus Imprint Support Nexus 5X - Marshmallow. Use to love it, but want to have this as my default lockscreen but cannot until it supports fingerprint unlock and use as replacement for standard lockscreen. Will keep in waiting....
57a096825623ed09ac76299b;Why isn't this part of stock Android? Love it!
57a096825623ed09ac76299c;Great app Works as described. Is there any way to remove the persistent notification?
57a096825623ed09ac76299d;Simple adjustments pls For example allowing it to use your lock screen background not your home screen wallpaper
57a096855623ed09ac76299e;Almost perfect. But I need lock/unlock sound
57a096855623ed09ac76299f;Nice but some remarks I have an s6 and sometimes when I click on the notification bubble in acdisplay it stays blank which is annoying. Would be nice to be able to use my fingerprint reader as well. Awesome app tho! Would recommend.
57a096855623ed09ac7629a0;Almost! Great minimalist lock screen. The wave proximity sensor unlocking function should be improved though. As well as adding more options for swiping from upper/lower right/left, not just dialer and camera. And it would also be perfect if you can edit the size of the clock. Hihi. Still an awesome app though! :)
57a096895623ed09ac7629a1;Stop working This morning my acdisplay suddenly stop working, I tried to uninstall n reinstall agn. I even try to turn off every security
57a096895623ed09ac7629a2;Excellent but not to my liking.
57a096895623ed09ac7629a3;Best lock screen I've been using it for years and it's just great. Simple, beautiful and functional. The app is awesome but a couple of months ago started doing weird things, notifications dissappear even if I don't open them, the music widget doesn't work as it should, after I unlock the screen 2 or 3 times it stops working. These problems are really annoying and it was working great before. Please fix it, I would love to keep using this app. I'm using a Xiaomi MI 3.
57a0968b5623ed09ac7629a4;Doesn't work
57a0968b5623ed09ac7629a5;Lag would you please , find a way to fix the screen lag? otherwise I love the app.
57a0968b5623ed09ac7629a6;Could be a very good app However it seems to be abandoned. There should be an option to change lock screen text color/opacity (or dim the brightness of it). It's too bright on amoled display. Also option to change font and size for clock would be nice.
57a0968b5623ed09ac7629a7;Best No battery drain. Working well. Update with password lock
57a0968f5623ed09ac7629a8;Please Add Fingerprint Pretty app, pretty function but locking is... well lame. Add a fingerprint see sorry and I'll use this permanently.
57a0968f5623ed09ac7629a9;Can't control musixmatch player I can not control musixmatch player in lock screen. üò•üò• that's bad. Pls fix. Please...
57a0968f5623ed09ac7629aa;Works just fine. Few complaints. Works as advertised. Very few bugs. Seems stable and useful. I hate how if I have an app open, ACDisplay will close it, and I'll have to manually go back into it every time I open my phone up. The feature that allows me to go directly into a notification doesn't work, but that's not a big deal. The design and amount of options are what make this app worth having.
57a096945623ed09ac7629ab;Almost perfect Thank you for providing such a great app. This is far better than the Samsung always on display. I have two suggestions that would make this a five star app IMO: It would be nice if I can adjust the delay when Active mode shows AC Display relative to me triggering the proximity sensor. Right now, it is about four seconds but I really want to be able to wave my hand over my phone. Second, I would like to have my phone behave as a clock full time when it is plugged in, and keep AC Display on.
57a096945623ed09ac7629ac;Cnt uninstall
57a096945623ed09ac7629ad;I love it Really nice looking and simple and useful, but just like everybody we want it as a lockscreen replacement
57a096975623ed09ac7629ae;Unlock without lock button U can unlock ur phone automatically when u take it out from ur pocket by using this app. Gr8 app to save the lock button.
57a096975623ed09ac7629af;Very Very good Please add quick reply...edit:no quick reply yet and no finger print suport
57a096975623ed09ac7629b0;I am not able to get notification on lock screen
57a096975623ed09ac7629b1;Beautiful and simple ! Very nice app. Simple and material design.
57a0969b5623ed09ac7629b2;Can't uninatall Ummmm it doesn't work at all for me and I can't Uninstaller it off my phone. Please help!
57a0969b5623ed09ac7629b3;Please update lockscreen I love this app, but it constantly freezes my Galaxy S5 when the lockscreen is enabled. Pleas update this app! I would pay for this functionality
57a0969b5623ed09ac7629b4;Just needs a bit more customization and security options
57a0969b5623ed09ac7629b5;Asus zenfone 2 laser As you know ASUS has no option to disable fabric lock screen you can just put it to swipe so i get delays on locker if you can fix it, pls fix it! And please delete Ac option reminder on notification bar
57a096a55623ed09ac7629b6;It seems that no one is listening to the feedbacks around here...?!? I'd very much like the option to add a custom screen locking/unlocking sound to the lockscreen. Thank you & keep up the good work!
57a096a75623ed09ac7629b7;Awful Can't uninstall.
57a096a75623ed09ac7629b8;Happy to use it
57a096a75623ed09ac7629b9;Useful üòòüòòüòòüòò Great app download it üëçüëçüëç
57a096a75623ed09ac7629ba;Weird with fingerprint reader and any other pin lock. Having to "unlock" twice. Very nice layout. Hope it works
57a096ad5623ed09ac7629bb;Thank you Great app I'm so familiar with the motorola active notifications and since I switched phones this is the best alternative thanks! Wow there's even more features than I realized. Developers here deserve donation bravo! Custom widgets enabled.
57a096ad5623ed09ac7629bc;I really like it, but there's a delay on the lockscreen function that makes the lockscreen visible only around 5 seconds after the phone locks. That delay really puts off the whole "immersive" feeling you want out of an app like this.
57a096ad5623ed09ac7629bd;Facing problem in Letv 1s It work fine for few weeks, but since last 2-3 days notification are not showing on lock screen, pls help me to resolve the problem as the app and concept is very good,really help a lot ,waiting for reply
57a096b05623ed09ac7629be;RAM Aggressive This lock screen feels like half bake. It lacks stability and stutters alot. But it is still the best lock screen out there...
57a096b05623ed09ac7629bf;Password I need to set a password. Please allow this app to set password
57a096b05623ed09ac7629c0;Not able to uninstall When I try to uninstall, it doesn't let me. I found that it needs to be unchecked from device administrator, when I try that it just kicks me out of the settings. Emailed this guys for support before posting this review and waited for a week for the reply but no response. Very disappointed.
57a096b05623ed09ac7629c1;Nice app Love your work
57a096b35623ed09ac7629c2;Please add one feature I really love this app. I just wish you can add a password such as a pattern as well; as an optional security measure. If you do, could you make it like the cyanogen mod one. Please
57a096b35623ed09ac7629c3;Adding widgets problem Can't add any widgets on lockscreen, setting suddenly stopped working. Would be better if have a built in pattern/pin locks
57a096b35623ed09ac7629c4;Great! I love how the simplicity applied in this lockscreen gives the idea of a cool way technology works. Just that can you help apply password features to make it look more of a 'lock' screen. Other than that, it's 110% awesome! Thank you!
57a096b85623ed09ac7629c5;It won't work The Google ambient display seems to override it. The test notification will work and that's it.
57a096b85623ed09ac7629c6;love it wow, the 1st app I must have on any setup
57a096b85623ed09ac7629c7;AcDisplay brings the Active Display mode from Moto devices in a free open source app. The basic feature of this app allows the device's screen to turn when a notification appears and to quickly and easily interact with the notifications. There are 2 other options as well, making this app serve as a lock screen and/or turn on the screen based on device sensors. The overall design is very much minimalistic with a great looking design, and there are also plenty of settings to customize to fit your liking. AcDisplay is great for those wanting to view notifications quickly with a minimal and usable design.
57a096ba5623ed09ac7629c8;Just one thing! Please add finger print direct unlock without swipe!
57a096ba5623ed09ac7629c9;It keeps asking me for a donation
57a096ba5623ed09ac7629ca;Great Overall, but Needs Lock Function This is one of the best looking and most inventive lock screens I have seen. However, it would be great to see a built-in lock function. It's the one thing keeping me from using this as my current lockscreen.
57a096ba5623ed09ac7629cb;Can't uninstall.
57a096ce5623ed09ac7629cc;works good for Samsung Galaxy s6 works good on Samsung Galaxy s6 some icons are wrong like for inbox and gmail or built in text messenger which shows delivery report right icon, but shows facebook icon for built in text messager messages and don't show textra messenger icon or chomp I've tried but shows handsent , I haven't had others wrong yet but apart from that works well and not a battery drain hardly notice it's running and it hasn't crashed or randomly jumping on screen like some others I tried so just needs few more updates sorted.
57a096ce5623ed09ac7629cd;5 star Great!
57a096d15623ed09ac7629ce;Absolutely hooked Smashing minimalistic design. One note: I would love to use it on my tablet as well, but it seems that it won't autorotate. Perhaps this is a local problem, but it would be nice to see that implemented. Nothing more I can wish for beyond that!
57a096d15623ed09ac7629cf;issues with fingerprint sensor fingerprint sensor doesn't seem to work when applied as a lockscreen. Using redmi note 3
57a096d15623ed09ac7629d0;Nexus Imprint killed. Please improve the compatibility.
57a096d15623ed09ac7629d1;Just can't be perfect Yah I know the developer wouldn't add security but that's what's missing
57a096d55623ed09ac7629d2;Best app ever I m enjoying it so much great effect and superb features.
57a096d55623ed09ac7629d3;Good but has some issues with marshmallow I used this on my old phone and if was flawless and I loved it. Now I have switched the the nexus 6p and am having some trouble. I noticed that sometimes when I had ac display activated I would not be able to use the finger print sensor even after I unlocked ac display and had to do a password. This is very frustrating so I cannot use ac display.
57a096d55623ed09ac7629d4;Cannot deactivate device administrator option on s6 edge The app is not allowing to disable the device administrator setting and force closes while doing so. I like the app very much though.
57a096d85623ed09ac7629d5;THIS IS THE PERFECT ONE! Now it only misses one thing: a security. After all, it's a lock screen, so it is pretty ironic for a lock screen to not have a security. Also hopefully more customizable, like being able to change your wallpaper. Also the notification bar shouldn't be able to go down while in the lockscreen. Those are my suggestions.
57a096d85623ed09ac7629d6;Great app!!
57a096d85623ed09ac7629d7;The best one
57a096d85623ed09ac7629d8;Good In it swap to unlock the device they have to provide a partton lock as well
57a096dd5623ed09ac7629d9;I would be glad if Fingerprint unlocking will come to AcDisplay I want to see this App as a real Lockscreen replacement üëç
57a096dd5623ed09ac7629da;Nice! Looks very good and is functional. The wave over to wake screen doesn't seem to work well on my HTC One. But other than that its fantastic.
57a096dd5623ed09ac7629db;Superb Nice! üëç
57a096dd5623ed09ac7629dc;Almost perfect Awesome work devs with this app, but one suggestion, I would really want to put a different lockscreen wallpaper Instead of black or home screen wallpaper, kindly add that stuff as well to add a custom lockscreen wallpaper
57a096e95623ed09ac7629dd;I have been using it for past 2-3 years and its one of the essential apps for me. Sometimes my phone gets unlocked while in pocket, which is annoying but apart from that, everything is good.
57a096e95623ed09ac7629de;Glance plus app (Why its better?) I don't want to use glance plus instead of ac display because acd, it's really beautiful! But I have to use glance plus because of two features: Customisable Analog Clock & Calender (both at different times can be added to lock screen). I don't want to use glance plus. Ac display team please, do something. Thanks. Waiting for your update, acd!
57a096ec5623ed09ac7629df;Please add "always on" mode
57a096ec5623ed09ac7629e0;Works Works great but why is it a constant running notification there should be a way to disable if you want to see that and have it not pop up
57a096ec5623ed09ac7629e1;Being a device administrator keeps getting disabled but other services are kept on. Please fix
57a096ec5623ed09ac7629e2;Works good Please make it no time off to changes between clock and notification. And make it clock moves is more great. Thank u
57a096ef5623ed09ac7629e3;Great but with its downsides (bugs) Awesome lockscreen for seeing and handling notifications. My favorite feature is that I can swipe from anywhere in any direction to unlock. Has a few (very) annoying (recent) bugs such as locking the screen while I'm using my phone if I get a notification or the proximity sensor causing unwanted locks while using
57a096ef5623ed09ac7629e4;Nice app
57a096ef5623ed09ac7629e5;Should add fingerprint/pin/pattern security and then it'd be perfect
57a096f25623ed09ac7629e6;Great, but seems to get frozen by Android 6.0.1 I love this app, but since upgrade to 6.0.1, the app gets frozen if there are no new notifications. This means the displayed time can be up to 30mins behind the actual time. Can I deactivate this ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù?
57a096f25623ed09ac7629e7;Can't uninstall Won't let me deactivate in order to uninstall.
57a096f25623ed09ac7629e8;Doesn't actually lock anything.
57a096f65623ed09ac7629e9;Amazing App This is cool because if you put your phone in your pocket and take it out it automatically turns it on which can be very convenient if you are waiting for someone to notify you for something. Also, when you turn on you phone you can see all notifications and choose whether to open them or dimiss them with ease.
57a096f65623ed09ac7629ea;Perfect I always wanted something like this but I wasn't able to find however I think now I have with you AC Display
57a096f65623ed09ac7629eb;Always on Can you add always on clock feature?
57a096f65623ed09ac7629ec;Try add a pass code.
57a096fb5623ed09ac7629ed;Simply superb..! Love the new animation.. It can have more options in customization
57a096fb5623ed09ac7629ee;Beautiful I love the look of this app. As long as it doesnt kill battery I'm cool. I haven't seen any quick battery drop yet, but its beautiful in the way it is.
57a096fb5623ed09ac7629ef;Good! ...But.. The app is extremely amazing and the UI is beautiful too, but anyone can access through my phone because there is no security.
57a096fb5623ed09ac7629f0;Dosent work... It dosent work on my Sony Aquos device tho and i will rate 5 because this is still beta and it works on my other phones and tablets
57a096fe5623ed09ac7629f1;Like but Love this app however just lately it's started going to the lockscreen everytime there is a notification regardless of if I'm in the middle of doing something. Very annoying
57a096fe5623ed09ac7629f2;Best lock screen app
57a096fe5623ed09ac7629f3;Works well I would love to see some security added to the lock screen function
57a096fe5623ed09ac7629f4;Notifications Notifications won't show up on lockscreen! :(
57a096fe5623ed09ac7629f5;üîë I really love this. I cannot adapt to others screen lock application. It really great. Ive tried to use another but i cant.
57a097015623ed09ac7629f6;Plz Add Lock Screen Feature to make it perfect.. Plz.......
57a097015623ed09ac7629f7;Sucked Sucked
57a097015623ed09ac7629f8;Few improvements til perfection Pls include blur option for the wallpaper and option to place the clock on the upper center of the screen.
57a097015623ed09ac7629f9;Loved it! Does what it claims! And very usefull
57a097035623ed09ac7629fa;Please Read This is my favorite lockscreen app. However, i cannot add widgets to the interface! Every time i try to choose a widget it will say "Unfortunately, Settings has stopped." This is a major issue for me. I have widgets enabled and everything. I've tried it all. Please fix as this is a great app.
57a097035623ed09ac7629fb;Too sad That's a horrible app
57a097035623ed09ac7629fc;Please add a password or pin option please, otherwise great work!
57a097035623ed09ac7629fd;The locker is cool but,... You need a security option
57a097085623ed09ac7629fe;Good one Can you add feature like moto display I.e screen lights up when we pick up the device or pick our device out of pocket
57a097085623ed09ac7629ff;Unable to remove the software from phone When I try to uncheck this tool from device administrators, android system app crashes... nexus 5 2013, android 6.0.1 with march update. Fix it asap
57a097085623ed09ac762a00;Can't see a single notification, nor can I remove apps from the blacklist, therefore this app is rubbish to say the least.
57a097085623ed09ac762a01;Locks me out of my phone. Try to press button to wake but screen stays black
57a0970c5623ed09ac762a02;Awesome app. Simple and neat.. Keep improving slowly
57a0970c5623ed09ac762a03;Its really great and quite stable
57a0970c5623ed09ac762a04;Brilliant app!! Edit: 'Had to uninstall. Started taking too much resources/battery in the background I don't know, if it's a bug or anything. Kindly fix it.' Really cool. It's a no nonsense app. Please do rem though this app keeps on running in the background and though it's not really a super heavy app but it's not feather weight either. It is perfectly fine by me, coz I find it to be totally worth it. It gives you a buttery smooth experience and the lock screen looks wise is damn cool. Love it. Thank you so much!!
57a0971a5623ed09ac762a05;Useless and can't uninstall why can't I Uninstall it
57a0971a5623ed09ac762a06;No unlock animation The app is great for personalisation, would give 5 stars if there was unlock animation on my samsung galaxy j7.........developers, do check my prob.
57a0971e5623ed09ac762a07;Nagyon hasznos!
57a0971e5623ed09ac762a08;Love it except... Updated my s6 to marshmallow and now the icons that show on the lock screen for notifications are screwed up - what's app shows as a triangle with ! inside, gmail is an h icon. What's going on?
57a0971e5623ed09ac762a09;Not good for Note 5 Cant disable the touch buttons on lock screen, keeps unlocking my phone on my pocket.
57a0971e5623ed09ac762a0a;Buggy experience after Lollipop update After i updated my fone to 5.0 lollipop d lockscreen became buggy. It unlocks by pressing home button n sometimes after swipe unlocking it locks d display again.. please fix this. Also a suggestion to include always on mode like v find on d new galaxy s7 n lg g5..
57a097215623ed09ac762a0b;Lame! Doesn't let me uninstall
57a097215623ed09ac762a0c;Killed by alarm Once alarm rings this locker stops working. Goes back to default phone locker. Got to disable and re-enable aclocker. Do fix this bug, much appreciated.
57a097215623ed09ac762a0d;Awesome. But some bugs. This app is really awesome. I love it. But it's got some flaws like: it's got some lag in animations while unlocking. And it freezes at times while trying to open. Otherwise great app. You guys are awesome!
57a097215623ed09ac762a0e;Pls fix a Bug Proximity sensor is not working properly. To wake it up, have to hold the proximity sensor for at least 5 sec. Phone model: Infocus
57a097265623ed09ac762a0f;Almost perfect. Please make it ALWAYS ON like the S7/Edge. And make it move randomly on the screen so it won't burn unless there's a way to do it. The way it handles notification is top notch and the material design is fantastic. Great work!
57a097265623ed09ac762a10;The application itself is really neat, it's exactly what i wanted, sadly the rating will be low due to it's not replacing the lockscreen, it's adding on top of it, which means i can't simply use my fingerscanner to go into the device immediately. The idea is 10/10 it's exactly what makes Android much better, hopefully this can be sorted.
57a0972c5623ed09ac762a11;best lock screen but.. no security features, you have to use the phones own lockscreen which will require you to unlock the device twice. please consider adding even just pin and pattern, this will allow us to keep the phone private among friends even if it is not really secure(I read the faqs my phone does not allow pins only, it comes with the default lockscreen my phone will have 2 lockscreens when i enable it)
57a0972c5623ed09ac762a12;Better than Moto's! This is outright the best active display there is.
57a0972c5623ed09ac762a13;Good app. Would have given 5 stars. But the active mode isn't working.

57a097305623ed09ac762a16;Great lock screen app The app is amazing but there is an lag between opening from locks screen and home screen display. Please fix it.
57a097305623ed09ac762a17;Impossible to uninstall Doesn't work with fingerprint API so you either have lower security or you have to unlock your device twice. Also you have to jump through hoops to uninstall this app, trying to deactivate it only causes Settings to crash.
57a097305623ed09ac762a18;Wow.... Fantastic Please develop some apps with same interface for Call screen, music app and lock screen with pin :) . Anyway, its lock screen didn't work on my xiaomi ( default lock screen comes first :( ]
57a097345623ed09ac762a19;Very nice start Needs support for fingerprint and or password üíØüíØüíØüíØ
57a097345623ed09ac762a1a;Good Until now its useful and good
57a097345623ed09ac762a1b;Allow custom wallpapers Lockscreen has either solid or current background option. No real customisation possible.
57a097345623ed09ac762a1c;Generally liking it, except... ... I'd love to see a feature for a different wallpaper than the one from home screen. That would be great!
57a097345623ed09ac762a1d;Not a lockscreen Great design and stylish way of showing notifications, but please add an actual lock screen with pattern, pin, etc...
57a097385623ed09ac762a1e;Working good Eating a lot of battery.
57a097385623ed09ac762a1f;how to delate this damn app i can't delate this app
57a097385623ed09ac762a20;Great app just needs a few additions This is a fantastic app for someone coming from the Motorola ecosystem that misses the active display as badly as I did. There needs to be a way to swipe the media player out of the way to access the normal acdisplay screen. There also needs to be an addition that brings up acdisplay when the phone is picked up after sitting for a set period of time. I have issues with the proximity wake but pulling it out of my pocket always seems to work. Otherwise this is a fantastic app!
57a0973b5623ed09ac762a21;Beautiful and functional Been using since ages and donated for Developer efforts
57a0973b5623ed09ac762a22;Can't uninstall It won't let me uninstall this no matter what I do
57a0973b5623ed09ac762a23;Love this app because this app like lollipop

57a0973b5623ed09ac762a25;Whenever an call comes on my device the phone doesnt wake up But when i disable acdisplay.. Guess what?? The phone wakes up on an incoming call
57a0973d5623ed09ac762a26;Please help Everything was running smoothly. I was getting whatsapp, messeges notification on my AcDisplay lockscreen.. As i installed your headsup display. Im not getting those notification even if i uninstalled everything. I want those notification. Please help me and then 5 stars to u
57a0973d5623ed09ac762a27;Awesome app. Very stylish. Would be better if it had security options
57a0973d5623ed09ac762a28;Needs tweaking time lags to update when I take a peek at my phone
57a0973d5623ed09ac762a29;Awesome.
57a097415623ed09ac762a2a;Not working properly on s7 Works for a period, then crashes and stops showing notifications.
57a097415623ed09ac762a2b;Buggy Nexus fingerprint doesn't work with this app, was a huge inconvenience. Hence uninstalled. Otherwise I loved the app. A sleek interface for those who mean business.
57a097415623ed09ac762a2c;One thing is missing.. The Pin/Password protection is needed
57a097415623ed09ac762a2d;Some issues Please remove the "acdisplay" in my notification bar! What is the purpose of that? Its annoying. Also this is a lockscreen with no security features...i can't even set a pattern or pin...there really should be a way to actually "lock" my phone. Other than that I really like it.
57a097505623ed09ac762a2e;Bug Whenever I lock my phone and try to unlock it later it just goes to the homescreen. How to fix this? EDIT: It was tasker, sorry for the inconvenience.
57a097545623ed09ac762a2f;Lacks security but still pretty awesome Everything about it is great just throw in a couple of security features maybe fingerprint support and it will be perfect
57a097545623ed09ac762a30;U just need to add more lock security then it would be perfect
57a097545623ed09ac762a31;Very usefull No worry without led
57a097545623ed09ac762a32;Notificaciones Todo est√° bien, excepto que las notificaciones (ejm. Un mensaje) no se elimina cuando la abres, tienes que borrarla manualmente, deber√≠an corregir eso, dem√°s, muy buena app.
57a097595623ed09ac762a33;Good. But this would probably be my go-to lockscreen app if you guys integrated a pass code and/or PIN feature.
57a097595623ed09ac762a34;Great app It uses my super amoled display very well. Minimum battery drain and good info supplier!
57a097595623ed09ac762a35;Battery Drains so fast Bcoz this app uses sensors to detect whether the phone in pocket or not. It drains a lot of battery. Also no security.
57a097595623ed09ac762a36;Please add! It's awesome indeed. But please add a feature to turn screen on when I pick it off the table, like the ambient display feature!
57a0975c5623ed09ac762a37;Password you should able to add a password. Like a minimalist password screen
57a0975c5623ed09ac762a38;I can't make out why the proximity sensor always get activated while the screen is locked. Do help. Else I'll gonna uninstall this app. Otherwise, it's a good job. Thanks.
57a0975c5623ed09ac762a39;Love the app, desperately needs nexus 6p fingerprint support.
57a0975c5623ed09ac762a3a;Great... Wonderful option for people who want a less cartoon like lockscreen/notification option. Especially LG and Samsung users like myself.
57a097625623ed09ac762a3b;Really useful, great app, I like all the features of the app especially the notification displayed when the phone took out from the pocket
57a097625623ed09ac762a3c;This app sucks mobile settings. Hello admin can you please tell me how to uninstall this application as it was showing administration.
57a097625623ed09ac762a3d;Just like Moto display but have some minor glitches.üáÆüá≥ü§ìüôèüëåüíú (1) Active mode works fine when lifting the phone faced down from a table, but doesn't work when I take the phone out of my pant pocket. (2) The app is causing random power off of my Android One device running Android 6.0.1. (3) Add more watch faces, like Galaxy Gear S2 watch face.
57a097625623ed09ac762a3e;Wtf Users cannot uninstall it
57a0976a5623ed09ac762a3f;Super useful
57a0976a5623ed09ac762a40;Probably the best of it's kind, but It glitches often. When I press an icon, the notification doesn't always appear, can't always get past the lock screen either. Perhaps it's not updated for Marshmallow, but it's so close!
57a0976a5623ed09ac762a41;Actually amazing, but You know I actually life this one it looks amazing, its simple, and looks and feels like a new phone. The only reason why I didn't go full five stars is because there is no password feature...I honestly would have loved to use this locker if it had that, but my family is pretty snaeky and I have many little sisters that like to go into my phone and mess it up.hahahah. but yah if it had a password option it would be the best one out thereüòÄ!!!
57a0976f5623ed09ac762a42;Amazing app I love this app the only problem is, it takes much RAM. Even recommended this to my friends and they loved it. Thumbs up!
57a0976f5623ed09ac762a43;To the developer Please make an always on display option!
57a0976f5623ed09ac762a44;I got a solution to add security Enable developers option and enable skip lock screen and if you have password it will only display the password page AC display will pop up first then the password page

57a0977e5623ed09ac762a50;What Happened? I really loved Amaze but the recent update broke a lot of key functions. For example moving or even copying files results in errors now.
57a0977e5623ed09ac762a51;Better than most Moved from es to this and glad I did. Easier to use, nicer design. Fast lightweight
57a0977e5623ed09ac762a52;No SMB support This is supposed to be there. The change log gives no clue as to how it disappeared. Since that's the only reason I wanted it, I uninstalled it immediately.

57a0977f5623ed09ac762a54;Need this 1)Besides copy and delete, add 'cut' button too. 2) Add a Recycle Bin so that deleted files can be retrieved. This app is light and bloatware free and I loved this.

57a097825623ed09ac762a58;only had it for a few minutes so far, but so far I love it! simple to use and quick to learn and setup how you want it, even has a dark theme and custom colour settings! Instantly decided to make this my main file explorer especially since EZ File Explorer is trying so hard to burn its self to the ground. Only thing I can think of that is missing is the ability to add bookmarks to folders on the android home screen/descktop. I have a couple folders I access regularly that are buried in the android/data folders.
57a097845623ed09ac762a59;Excellent app Everything is flawless , I had an issue with the previous version but now it's perfect !
57a097845623ed09ac762a5a;Clean look and use.. that's enough to get a 5 star I loved it
57a097845623ed09ac762a5b;USB OTG I'd just like the ability to read/write files on a usb thumb drive using my usb-c to usb-a adapter.
57a097845623ed09ac762a5c;Where did Samba support go?? I used to be able to access my network shares through amaze, now I don't see any such option or setting anywhere, did you guys remove it for some reason?
57a097865623ed09ac762a5d;That's not a good update A rollback would be best option. Folder size and content not shown anymore. And that's just one issue.. Update: uninstalled. Move files also not working. This is app simply doesn't work. It doesn't do what a file manager does. So what's the point. Uninstalled.
57a097865623ed09ac762a5e;Root Explorer breaks everything Half the UI dissappears when browsing root folders
57a097865623ed09ac762a5f;The go to File Manager I generally don't rate an app with five stars, but this one is simple, intuitive, beautiful, customizable, free and most importantly ad free.
57a097865623ed09ac762a60;What happened to this app? What use to be a clear obvious UI has become weird. Where is "move"?
57a097875623ed09ac762a61;needs split screen
57a097875623ed09ac762a62;Wow. Just wow.
57a097875623ed09ac762a63;Important options have been removed! 1. The move option has disappeared, can no longer move folders around. 2. When using the cut and paste option instead. It keeps showing as unsuccessful? 3. Shows my sdcard again which is good! 4. Actually going to uninstall this until fixed.
57a097875623ed09ac762a64;Not working App crashes any time I try to copy/paste or delete a file
57a0978a5623ed09ac762a65;Crashed Latest version of the app forced closed when I tried to delete a file. Otherwise, a good light-weight file explorer.
57a0978a5623ed09ac762a66;Forced Stop on deleting files. Its gets lagged everytime i open it.and it gets unable to use.it also mix up the folders display.and also on deleting images it forced stops.pls bring new update and fix
57a0978a5623ed09ac762a67;Cool! Best FM I've ever used.
57a0978c5623ed09ac762a68;Last version unusable. Could not start because of trying to cast an Integer to String or vice versa during startup. Had to delete app data and lost lot of bookmarks. Then, attempting to search and multiple problems. Click search area to update text and it disappears. Hit back button and app crashes with NPE in some fixSlashes method. Have to uninstall and switch to another, more stable, browser. Too bad, I used this app for a long time but I need something stable.
57a0978c5623ed09ac762a69;The grid and list view are changing randomly, could you please fix it?
57a0978e5623ed09ac762a6a;Crashes if you have back navigation enabled in settings and leave the app. Also, the navigation bar is colored by default but the toggle in settings is off at first launch.
57a0978e5623ed09ac762a6b;Finally, ftp server
57a0978e5623ed09ac762a6c;Deleted and Re-installed, Fixed Now Thank you for replying, dev! I cleared data but it didn't work, so I just uninstalled and reinstalled Amaze. Works like the first day I installed it again. Thanks for your work.
57a097915623ed09ac762a6d;Functions Broken The "move"option has been completely removed with only the choice to "cut", but even when copying and pasting folders in my storage, it crashes and only copies half or less the files. Please fix.
57a097925623ed09ac762a6e;Excellent! Open, free & easy.
57a097925623ed09ac762a6f;Free open source and excellent.
57a097925623ed09ac762a70;very nice ... please add ftp client
57a097925623ed09ac762a71;Nice and simple, non-bloated with Material Design

57a09bc05623ed09ff6db827;Some functions missing...
57a09bc05623ed09ff6db828;Works great
57a09bc35623ed09ff6db829;can't handle Hacker's Keyboard won't resize viewport properly
57a09bc35623ed09ff6db82a;Works best in combination with "The Hackers Keyboard", since one needs Ctrl, Alt, Escape etc. What I miss is a proxy option to connect to a hidden sshd over tor (orbot).
57a09bc35623ed09ff6db82b;Swipe for alt and cursor I used to be able to swipe the screen in irssi and would switch windows it doesn't anymore üå≤
57a09bc35623ed09ff6db82c;Works great for ssh, good ui
57a09bc55623ed09ff6db82d;Almost Perfect - but I can't import my key?! Please allow import key again. I know it works before but right now it just did nothing after I select the private key file.
57a09bc55623ed09ff6db82e;Amazing Perfect functionality. Simple and beautiful layout. Its perfect.
57a09bc55623ed09ff6db82f;Could be better Needs better support for devices without physical keyboard such as Galaxy Nexus.
57a09bc55623ed09ff6db830;Works and works well SSH, port forwarding, keys, everything
57a09bc75623ed09ff6db831;The best SSH client for Android The App works well and is also well designed.
57a09bc75623ed09ff6db832;Wow.. Good app
57a09bc75623ed09ff6db833;Perfect tool Straight to business easy to use application. Perfect for managing all manner of SSH enabled devices.
57a09bc75623ed09ff6db834;Has everything I need It provides every feature I have desired and some I didn't realize I wanted
57a09bc75623ed09ff6db835;Sweeeeeet Good app, thanks.
57a09bc85623ed09ff6db836;Awesom app Love it.
57a09bc85623ed09ff6db837;No documentation broken keyboard Needs more public key support
57a09bc85623ed09ff6db838;Cannot live without it anymore That's it! It works as a Shell Terminal (works beautifully with root), Telnet and SSH client. The only thing it lacks is a way of choosing the default Shell (mksh, bash, etc).
57a09bc85623ed09ff6db839;Best ssh for Android
57a09bc85623ed09ff6db83a;Luv u Keep up the good work!
57a09bc95623ed09ff6db83b;Bad interface The UI is bad, and you cant even see what you type.
57a09bc95623ed09ff6db83c;Great SSH app No hassle ssh app
57a09bc95623ed09ff6db83d;Perfect! It's perfect. Nothing more to add.
57a09bc95623ed09ff6db83e;Simple and no ads!! Love it
57a09bc95623ed09ff6db83f;Free. Simple. Lightweight. Enough Cant ask for more. Love it. 5 stars
57a09bcb5623ed09ff6db840;Almost perfect GSSAPI/Kerberos support and an equivalent to ProxyCommand would be useful additions. Edit: the recent addition of softkeys (arrows and tab) in portrait mode is very useful. Would bump to 4.5 if allowed...
57a09bcb5623ed09ff6db841;Umm I dont know how to use this
57a09bcb5623ed09ff6db842;Possibly lacks some fancy features but this simple SSH client always gets the job done when I need it. Easy to use. Maybe not for heavy SSH users with complex setups.
57a09bcb5623ed09ff6db843;Love this app very good keep up gd work
57a09bcd5623ed09ff6db844;Good but could be better Please let me know how can I get my last ran command?
57a09bcd5623ed09ff6db845;Nice app It has a very good interface and works fine.
57a09bcd5623ed09ff6db846;Great App I use this to connect to compute servers primarily to monitor jobs. One improvement I'd suggest is better screen management with landscape orientation. I like the volume control to change screen text font. I can't still figure out how to vertical scroll the screen. No sliders. Very very good tool with a few limitations. Scp up would be good too.
57a09bcd5623ed09ff6db847;? I don't know how to use this application can you explain me ?
57a09bd05623ed09ff6db848;Editor works bad When i delete a text using nano or vi editor, words in cursor position jumbles up and mesh the code.
57a09bd05623ed09ff6db849;Ottima Bella l'integrazione del terminale su android. Pi√π semplice √® difficile da fare.
57a09bd05623ed09ff6db84a;Perfect Works very well, favorite SSH client that I've used.
57a09bd05623ed09ff6db84b;love it I dont know what am doing :(
57a09bd35623ed09ff6db84c;Great Would love save password option, though. Although JuiceSSH is also great, I give slight edge to ConnectBot because of 10x smaller app size, and more logical virtual keyboard management.
57a09bd35623ed09ff6db84d;Works perfectly, including RSA/DSA/EC pub/private key auth, port forwards, copy/paste, etc. NOTE: If your keyboard doesn't have a "ctrl" key, nor a "trackball", tap on the screen for helpful CTRL/ESC/TAB/cursor keys - had me worried for a few mins!
57a09bd35623ed09ff6db84e;Works awesome! Can use public key to authenticate!
57a09bd35623ed09ff6db84f;The best ssh client Android can have! I used other ssh apps. It's straightforward and easy.
57a09bd55623ed09ff6db850;Very good
57a09bd55623ed09ff6db851;Nice and much smaller than top rated one but won't do landscape orientation Nice and much smaller than top rated one but won't do landscape orientation which makes it hard to edit in nano etc.
57a09bd55623ed09ff6db852;Highly recommended. Perfect. Works like a charm
57a09bd55623ed09ff6db853;Awesome
57a09bd55623ed09ff6db854;The best SSH client!
57a09bd75623ed09ff6db855;Incredibly useful It just does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. I've even used it for some light programming. You should probably install Hacker's Keyboard as well, even simple shell commands get pretty frustrating pretty quickly with anything else I've tried.
57a09bd75623ed09ff6db856;The best SSH client!
57a09bd75623ed09ff6db857;easy to use ... cool desing help me to manage my routers ... hope this not collect user credentials XD
57a09bd75623ed09ff6db858;Great app A+
57a09bdb5623ed09ff6db859;Works brilliantly. Lots of features, including tunnelling and private key authentication. The extra CTRL/ESC/TAB/arrow keys which appear above the standard keyboard make it possible to de serious work with this app.
57a09bdb5623ed09ff6db85a;Long time user Just had to refresh my rating, this app is amazing, it's rock solid, and does everything you want with SSH, even tunneling.The keyboard has improved over the years, and is ultimate! Now that the arrow and ctrl keys remain present for multi presses, for touch only keyboards, it makes navigating around the screen simply and easy. Well done for the years of free access to simply the best SSH app on Play!
57a09bdf5623ed09ff6db85b;Thanks for this I tried other apps that have received higher ratings, but yours was simpler to use, with a logical interface, and easily connected me to my school's Unix server, after I'd given up on the others working at all. Thanks!
57a09bdf5623ed09ff6db85c;Works well Easy and simple to use. Missing ipv6 support. Will change to 5 star when fixed.
57a09bdf5623ed09ff6db85d;Perfect. This app is perfect. Thk.
57a09bdf5623ed09ff6db85e;AWESOME
57a09bdf5623ed09ff6db85f;Good app. I like it
57a09be15623ed09ff6db860;Just what I needed My long quest is finally over. Thank you for this awesome application.
57a09be15623ed09ff6db861;Wow. I used to have a real DEC VT-100. Now I have one ...and more... and faster than 9600bps without UART glitching... in color... in my pocket. In an app that's better than the original. And a lot quieter than a TeleType. I'm the same age as the VT-100. Wow.
57a09be15623ed09ff6db862;√ötil Muy buena para conectar sesiones locales y remotas
57a09be15623ed09ff6db863;Great Especially when used in combination with Hacker's Keyboard!
57a09be35623ed09ff6db864;Excellent app Just one extra functionality would make it perfect: qyick method for closing tunnel,like extra widget ?
57a09be35623ed09ff6db865;Awesome Small size and works as expected. Excellent work. Could you guys add an option to keep the soft keyboard (ctrl, tab, arrows, etc) always visible, please?
57a09be35623ed09ff6db866;5star Great application .. please let me know how to create multiple session with the same IP (host)
57a09be35623ed09ff6db867;Best SSH Client for Android! I love ConnectBot, but it doesn't work in landscape mode in both directions... Once that works, 5 stars!
57a09be55623ed09ff6db868;Works well I use it with Hacker's Keyboard. An option to use a custom font with UTF-8 support is missing and would be very appreciated.
57a09be55623ed09ff6db869;Great app Love this app. Helpful responsive developers. A security PIN would be a jolly good improvement, to protect my keys.
57a09be55623ed09ff6db86a;Perfect for making some free space If you uninstall this useless app
57a09be75623ed09ff6db86b;The best SSH client that I have used on Android phones. It's compatible with the standard keyboard. It gives you the tab features and the arrows without need to install any special keyboard. Also it support SSH keys and connect to multiple servers.
57a09be75623ed09ff6db86c;I for the life of me cannot get this app to communicate with any server other than a "local' connection. I connect to the servers just fine. The keyboard comes up, and nothing. I can't believe I am the only person that has this problem, but nothing comes up in google searches.
57a09be75623ed09ff6db86d;Very good Very good ssh client.
57a09be75623ed09ff6db86e;Great Very useful
57a09be95623ed09ff6db86f;Thank you for free As in freedom.

57a09be95623ed09ff6db871;Need terminal ? Use this Great free tool for developer
57a09be95623ed09ff6db872;Great SSH client I am using it almost daily for ages now. Highly recommended. Thanks!
57a09be95623ed09ff6db873;works great with my Raspberry Pi 2
57a09beb5623ed09ff6db874;Love it Best SSH client for Android. Support for ssh-keys is an awesome thing. :)
57a09beb5623ed09ff6db875;As a Linux user at home and work, this is very useful! I use this with port forwarding and tight ufw rules to securely access my laptop. Setting up key-based login is a little fussy but once done it is smooth as glass.
57a09beb5623ed09ff6db876;Keren Aplikasinnya
57a09beb5623ed09ff6db877;So useful! Great, easy to use, has saved me a bunch of times.
57a09beb5623ed09ff6db878;Good Usefull tool
57a09bed5623ed09ff6db879;On the blackberry Priv..... If I could map the esc and ctrl keys this wold be perfect..... The Priv has a hardware kb but no trackball
57a09bed5623ed09ff6db87a;Really good With Hacker's Keyboard it is the perfect SSH client. No limits.
57a09bed5623ed09ff6db87b;Parsing error when importing private key. Migrated to JuiceSSH
57a09bed5623ed09ff6db87c;Nice ssh app Great app but it would be nice if it had an option to save your connection password.
57a09bed5623ed09ff6db87d;Goooood Simple and does what it is supposed to do without unnecessary sh**

57a09bee5623ed09ff6db882;Awesome The console is fast enough to handle ascii animations :)
57a09bf05623ed09ff6db883;Top Works perfect
57a09bf05623ed09ff6db884;no ipv6 please add ipv6 support or is there any way to use ipv6?
57a09bf05623ed09ff6db885;Great Ssh client It supports ncurses based mplayer better than Juice SSH.
57a09bf05623ed09ff6db886;Who knows if it works or not.... you can't connect via ip address only via dns host name. Let's get the basics right so people use this app in a secure environment without having to advertise their system to the entire world.
57a09bf05623ed09ff6db887;It's working fine...but its slow...
57a09bf35623ed09ff6db888;loved it keren banget, tapi ini aman tidak ya?
57a09bf35623ed09ff6db889;Server admins will love it
57a09bf35623ed09ff6db88a;On tablet won't even install Have this on a phone and it's great so tried to install it on a tablet. Play store offers it, then crashes. Not sure what's causing that?
57a09bf35623ed09ff6db88b;I also can't use pre-existing keys I have a private key on my sd card but the option to browse to the key doesn't work and only shows an entry named DBFile.db. This program worked before but no longer does.
57a09bf55623ed09ff6db88c;This is great for connecting to the Raspberry PI with public-key authenticated ssh! With a Pi cam connected, you can verify that the light is off in your refrigerator from anywhere in the world!
57a09bf55623ed09ff6db88d;Very good This tool is very good. I use it to connect to my headles raspberry pi
57a09bf55623ed09ff6db88e;Excellent and simple ssh client. New version even better now it has arrow keys! I have used this for years multiple times a week and would not change a thing.
57a09bf55623ed09ff6db88f;Best app Definitely the best app for remote server administration.
57a09bf75623ed09ff6db890;The only terminal... ...I will ever use on Android.
57a09bf75623ed09ff6db891;Key exchange problem I like this app, but version 1.8.6 has key exchange probelm. It always appear ‚ÄúHotkey signature sent by remote is wrong.‚Äù during ssh connection. Hope it can be fixed in the next verion.
57a09bf75623ed09ff6db892;1 star to get attention Please make autoreconect with latest password. I will change ratting, app is awesome.
57a09bf75623ed09ff6db893;Almost perfect.

57a09bfd5623ed09ff6db89a;SSH client Praktis Sangat membantu manage server dr manapun, aplikasinya ringan, simpel, user friendly. Recommended deh... :)
57a09bfd5623ed09ff6db89b;Minor error / issue /problem. This app has served me well for many years. I use it to tunnel into my VPS on a regular basis. I'm having a minor issue where the second password box won't come up if I'm using challenge authentication unless I back out and click the connection again. (I use two factor with libpam-google-authenticator)
57a09c005623ed09ff6db89c;cursor is under the keyboard cursor is under the keyboard,can't see it,please fix it.
57a09c005623ed09ff6db89d;nice addition: more soft-buttons. thx!
57a09c005623ed09ff6db89e;Can't use latest version I used to love this app, but installed the latest version on my new Galaxy 6 and can't use it because it won't let me navigate the filesystem to import a key.
57a09c005623ed09ff6db89f;Bom O VX ConnectBot √© uma vers√£o melhorada deste aplicativo.
57a09c005623ed09ff6db8a0;nice app volume keys change font size!
57a09c065623ed09ff6db8a1;Doesn't work on home system. Useless.
57a09c065623ed09ff6db8a2;Crashing after update It was good...actually awesome.But last update dint go well for the app.switching to juice.
57a09c065623ed09ff6db8a3;Best app for ssh proxy. If you want to use ssh tunnel to route all your android traffic then this is mush have app for you. After this you will also have to download ProxyDroid to apply system wide socks5 proxy.
57a09c065623ed09ff6db8a4;Physical keyboard Works for few seconds and then I cannot use any keyboard.
57a09c0a5623ed09ff6db8a5;Sweet & Simple! I love this app. It is open source, absolutely free and functional! It's sweet and simple and quite frankly all that I need. Other ssh apps are nice and all but I don't need all that extra functionality for simply ssh-ing into and managing my DigitalOcean droplets. Plus if I need more functionality I can simply modify the source code adding what I need and simply send it upstream for others to enjoy as well. 5 Stars for such an exceptional open source app that I use almost daily!
57a09c0a5623ed09ff6db8a6;Complete button Very good, with button tab and arrow navigation. The other similar apps only provide Esc and Ctrl button
57a09c0a5623ed09ff6db8a7;No keyboard input on Samsung Notepro12. Uninstalled.
57a09c0b5623ed09ff6db8a8;I can't type anymore! A recent update is preventing me for typing at the command line. This makes the app useless.
57a09c0b5623ed09ff6db8a9;Excellent!

57a09c0b5623ed09ff6db8ac;Fantastic app for connecting to servers over ssh With the latest update adding arrow keys this app is now perfect.
57a09c0e5623ed09ff6db8ad;Fullscreen scrolling problem The console cannot scroll to the last line or the line where the cursor is when fullscreen mode is on and the keyboard active. Else everything is good.
57a09c0e5623ed09ff6db8ae;Good Can't complain
57a09c0e5623ed09ff6db8af;Key exchange issue persists Randomly fails to connect to SSH host due to key exchange issue. Works fine with JuiceSSH. Will give 5 stars when fixed. Thanks.
57a09c0e5623ed09ff6db8b0;Connect bot Great App I heard by one if my colleague to control your PC remotely..
57a09c0e5623ed09ff6db8b1;Brilliant Does everything I want!
57a09c105623ed09ff6db8b2;Much happier since I discovered how to hit tab!
57a09c105623ed09ff6db8b3;By far the best SSH client for Android Essential for managing Unix based systems. Combined with Hackers Keyboard, it is an excellent terminal app
57a09c105623ed09ff6db8b4;import not working
57a09c105623ed09ff6db8b5;essential. although some commands are cumbersome, you just need to sit back and realize your on a mobile device. very happy and will not use another app.
57a09c125623ed09ff6db8b6;Great for the sysadmin on the move It's great to be able to shell into my various servers from my phone. And the addition of a tab key in the latest version is very welcome.
57a09c125623ed09ff6db8b7;Very good This is very close to perfect. I use it all the time. If there's one thing I would like to see improved, it's the fact that function keys don't work on hardware keyboards. If they could be made to work, then it would be perfect!
57a09c125623ed09ff6db8b8;Hard to make it work Other similar apps are much better.
57a09c125623ed09ff6db8b9;Works perfect Does exactly what it says it does. Brilliantly simple interface. Love it
57a09c465623ed09ff6db8ba;Six stars! This is truly the PuTTY of Android apps. Nuff said.
57a09c465623ed09ff6db8bb;√à stato amore a prima vista. Non solo √® software libero (licenza Apache 2), ma √® stato semplicissimo connettermi al mio irssi dentro uno screen: * la gestione della mia chiave √® intuitiva, posso inserire la passphrase una volta e per un po' la ricorda (alla ssh-add), ma non se sono molte ore che non la uso; * il beep ha funzionato subito nel modo che volevo io, configurazione facilissima; * la micro-tastiera virtuale √® facile da far comparire e ha tutto quello che mi serve, in particolare "esc" per dare comandi a irssi; nell'ultimo aggiornamento anche tab e le frecce. Peccato che ci sia solo ssh e non mosh: mantenere la connessione in treno o autostrada √® un'impresa. Per il resto, l'unica cosa che √® pi√∫ semplice in JuiceSSH √® che trova la chiave anche se la si mette in un posto a caso invece che nel root della memoria.
57a09c4a5623ed09ff6db8bc;Great app, recent deal-breaker bug fixed Great, love it, use it daily. Recent releases caused me problems with function and other special keys in Hacker's Keyboard, all good now. Thanks!
57a09c4a5623ed09ff6db8bd;Nice!!
57a09c4a5623ed09ff6db8be;Okay New meta key bar is too transparent and not very tall. Could use improvement.
57a09c4a5623ed09ff6db8bf;No ctrl key OS 2.3.4 droid x no trackball so no ctrl key needed in pine to send email or pico to save text.
57a09c4a5623ed09ff6db8c0;Useful and well made
57a09c4f5623ed09ff6db8c1;Excellent SSH client I feel like it as they same putty I'm using in my PC. No other client app gave such functions as same as putty

57a09c4f5623ed09ff6db8c3;What a difference an update makes... For awhile, ConnectBot had fallen behind.. No updates, dubious behavior with Bluetooth keyboards and some unusual ui quirks.. Well, I can't say it's now quirk free, but I can say that in terms of core features provided, it's definitely catching up to JuiceSSH. One particularly nifty feature present in ConnectBot that's a pay feature in JuiceSSH is port forwarding.. Very helpful when wanting to quickly check things behind a firewall... Now if only Android browsers made it easier to set custom proxies...
57a09c515623ed09ff6db8c4;Open source... Better pay for JuiceSSH
57a09c515623ed09ff6db8c5;Best SSH client However latest build has broken the local shell on my S5, it force-closes when I try to start a local shell. It used to work. Update: Fixed! Thanks :)
57a09c515623ed09ff6db8c6;Use it often It's very handy for command line access to servers I manage and also to run commands on the phone or tablet.
57a09c515623ed09ff6db8c7;Great and minimal ssh client...thanks
57a09c555623ed09ff6db8c8;The latest update from this week is the worst one I've ever seen, it makes the app usage basically not possible. Please return the previous version it worked. Now it does not allow self signed certificate keys, which means you cannot connect it to any hardware device which do not have external certificates, especially home routers. Who will pay hundreds or thousands dollars for a certificate to connect to home router??????
57a09c555623ed09ff6db8c9;Wuhu Like this really nice app :) free your android
57a09c555623ed09ff6db8ca;Keyboard shortcuts awesome Adding the arrow and tab key shortcuts makes it so much easier to take care of tasks on a small phone screen (particularly the tab for auto-completion).
57a09c585623ed09ff6db8cb;Fantastic
57a09c585623ed09ff6db8cc;For Raspberry PI I use it to connect to my Raspberry PI and it works flawlessly
57a09c585623ed09ff6db8cd;Great app now even better Fixed local shell! Arrow/tab keys are a big help. Now I can use the default on-screen keyboard and still get tab completion and shell history.
57a09c585623ed09ff6db8ce;Excellent An excellent open source (essential for this type of app) ssh client, with full private key management, good terminal emulation and port forwarding
57a09c5a5623ed09ff6db8cf;Works like a charm Does exactly what you need from an SSH client. It's best to use it in combination with Hacker's Keyboard
57a09c5a5623ed09ff6db8d0;Perfect Excellent SSH client.
57a09c5a5623ed09ff6db8d1;Local crash fixed And it's again the best SSH client! Even better!
57a09c5a5623ed09ff6db8d2;Thank you It does what it says, to the fullest, and I have been pushing my friends and family to use it. 5 stars.
57a09c6b5623ed09ff6db8d3;Oh well... I don't need it on my home screen, and looks like it can't be added to lock-screen on my Core Prime with Lollipop. Only way I see is using app to change entire lock-screen...
57a09c6b5623ed09ff6db8d4;Widget The only widget I use on my homescreen. This and muzei keep my homescreen minimalist and clean.
57a09c6b5623ed09ff6db8d5;Useless Nothing shows up in the box.
57a09c6b5623ed09ff6db8d6;Not found in widgets My security settings are on for widgets, still I can't see this in list.
57a09c6d5623ed09ff6db8d7;Frequently removes itself Seems like every few days in adding this widget to my phone again. It mysteriously disappears...
57a09c6d5623ed09ff6db8d8;Disappointing that it does not work on a Nexus 5x. There is no way to configure the app to appear on the lock screen as per the instructions. They should list the devices this app works on and/or does not - that would be helpful, rather than waste time trying to troubleshoot before realizing it just won't work.
57a09c6d5623ed09ff6db8d9;Great and Free
57a09c6f5623ed09ff6db8da;Exceptionally great! Does exactly what it says. Easy to set up, options are great. Dev is quick to respond and frequently adds features (daydream! The most amazing addition! This completely changes the way I'll be using both my N7 and N4 with their docks. Thank you!)
57a09c6f5623ed09ff6db8db;A few issues then five stars If you could fix the portrait mode on the galaxy s6 and have an auto dimming feature it would be a five star app.
57a09c6f5623ed09ff6db8dc;Extensions should be aligned center. Please make those extensions align to center once they are added :)
57a09c735623ed09ff6db8dd;Its ok I use the other widgets without the clock. But does not count my mail. Maybe because I use blue mail as my default mail app. Another annoying thing is the color. Its not white, it's grey and not very visible. One more star if we get option to use color codes.
57a09c735623ed09ff6db8de;I can't figure out how to get this to work properly on my Galaxy S7 running Marshmallow. The instructions (swipe to the left-most lock screen...) just aren't applicable; if I enable the lock screen and swipe, I get a keypad and a prompt to enter my pin. All I wanted was to see the time at night while my phone was charging. I used to have that functionality with DockClock Plus, but that app doesn't work under Marshmallow. If anyone can point me to instructions as to how to properly enable this app under Marshmallow, please respond. (Well... you can't really respond, but you could post a new review...) Addendum: If you send an email to the developer, you get an automated response directing you to a website that no longer exists. (404 error) Not a good sign.
57a09c765623ed09ff6db8df;Meh not really much but still good when it gives me the time. Nah I won't say anything special about this, but it's good and I won't get carried away about it. Just let me say this is a semi-great widget and we'll leave it at that.
57a09c765623ed09ff6db8e0;Great concept if it worked consistently Great potential. However a few quirks.. Wunderlist settings stopped working. Weather does not updated on the home screen.
57a09c765623ed09ff6db8e1;Well Done Great looking, minimalistic and simple to use üòÄ Well done
57a09c765623ed09ff6db8e2;Widget Isn't Appearing On Lockscreen How to add this widget on the lock screen? Please help.
57a09c785623ed09ff6db8e3;Best Dashclock widget... still weather extension not working well.
57a09c785623ed09ff6db8e4;Looks nice, but can't get it to work I have 4.4.2, Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Pro. The is no Enable Widgets in my security settings. My Lock Screen settings has a option for apps, that doesn't seem to be it. Anyone know how to get it to Work?
57a09c785623ed09ff6db8e5;Great idea behind this! Having a widget that allows several apps to have access to the widget, therefore all displaying in one place is such a useful idea. It's a shame that more apps than are currently available can't display on the widget. Suppose the app dev can't be blamed for that though.
57a09c7a5623ed09ff6db8e6;Lockscreen clock Lockscreen clock not changed, its still the default lockscreen clock. i enable widget at security settings. Sorry but not working on me. Uninstalling.
57a09c7a5623ed09ff6db8e7;Froze Fitbit extension and weather extension hasn't worked for a few months.
57a09c7a5623ed09ff6db8e8;Minimalist at its finest Best minimal clock and weather widget. I have tried paid versions of chronus, zooper, uccw, etc. But this is perfect.
57a09c7a5623ed09ff6db8e9;Loved it! This widget is much better than the original one of Resurrection Remix!
57a09c7e5623ed09ff6db8ea;Great but... ...can you make an option to hide the scrollbar in the expanded widget?
57a09c7e5623ed09ff6db8eb;Superb customisation app Works flawlessly on my Samsung s7. Could do with being able to see more than 3 widgets at the same time on the home screen though
57a09c7e5623ed09ff6db8ec;Great App!!! Loving it!!!
57a09c7e5623ed09ff6db8ed;Landscape daydream bug Great home screen app but when using it with daydream in landscape mode the clock bugs and gets stuck to the side of the screen. If not for bug it would be 5 stars
57a09c805623ed09ff6db8ee;So cool Use it with LockR for great lockscreen and on phone for device info.
57a09c805623ed09ff6db8ef;Back to it's best again. Weather is showing but it is not updating in Android marshmallow. :(
57a09c805623ed09ff6db8f0;Cool... It'd be nice if there was a widget that looked like the apps icon, that's why I downloaded it to begin with
57a09c875623ed09ff6db8f1;Dos relojes Buenas, la ser√≠a de 10 para mi salvo por una peque√±a tonteria que a mi me mata... Cuando tengo el widget del reloj en la pantalla, no necesito en reloj peque√±o de la barra superior y con esta App. Aparecen los dos. Tengo un xiaomi Redmi note 3, y el widget clock de f√°brica detecta que est√° el widget y oculta el reloj de la barra superior. Por lo dem√°s una App estupenda.
57a09c875623ed09ff6db8f2;Doesn't seem to work with Samsung's good lock I'm unable to add dash clock to the good lock app by Samsung (it allows widgets to replace the default clock on the lock screen). Otherwise, the app is perfect üëå
57a09c875623ed09ff6db8f3;working low resource
57a09c875623ed09ff6db8f4;Wonderful
57a09c8a5623ed09ff6db8f5;Great Love everything about it, though I would like options for the fenix extension to display just one, or two elements, instead of it being auto set to show all three.
57a09c8a5623ed09ff6db8f6;Awesome, should be built into OS Part of my default setup. Should just be integrated into Android OS. Amazingly affective application with a very clean Minimal design.
57a09c8a5623ed09ff6db8f7;Useful, but Texts in widget are not sharp!
57a09c8a5623ed09ff6db8f8;Yay!!! Weather is now working, thank you!! Happy, happy!
57a09c8c5623ed09ff6db8f9;Weather Please get the weather to display again!
57a09c8c5623ed09ff6db8fa;Simple and elegant widget This makes my home screen simple and clean, yet provides intuitive information.
57a09c8d5623ed09ff6db8fb;Good Nice
57a09c8d5623ed09ff6db8fc;Oh my lord, the weather is fixed! Finally, the weather is working. Hopefully this isn't a dream. I'm in disbelief.
57a09c8d5623ed09ff6db8fd;Hallelujah! Finally fixed!
57a09c8d5623ed09ff6db8fe;It is great! Just great, been using it for years.
57a09c8d5623ed09ff6db8ff;UPDATE: Weather No Longer Works Weather doesn't work. Still doesn't work after update claimed to fix it. Please fix, it's been over a couple months.
57a09c8f5623ed09ff6db900;Weather is still broken In my city always shows the same temperature and the umbrella icon

57a09c9f5623ed09ff6db905;1000x Better LOL üòÇ Idk how it's better than before, the only thing is that just I can monitor some unnecessary background process. For monitoring there are 1000 apps in market!

57a09c9f5623ed09ff6db907;I can't find the root button
57a09c9f5623ed09ff6db908;Awesome features that actually works
57a09ca15623ed09ff6db909;Works fine, i like it.
57a09ca15623ed09ff6db90a;Excellent I've been using it these past two weeks
57a09ca15623ed09ff6db90b;Settings don't stay The settings that I put for the processor just goes back to default after a reboot...
57a09ca15623ed09ff6db90c;Perfect app Developer this is perfect.. but boot restoration is not working in my phone... Need to reset my setting each time i boot. Otherwise its 5star app.
57a09ca15623ed09ff6db90d;Wat? I can't open it
57a09ca35623ed09ff6db90e;Set CPU Frequencies At Max It seems to be a good app, but it set my CPU minimum and maximum frequencies both at the max available. Made my phone heat up and drain the battery like crazy. I couldn't manually manipulate them either as it reset it every time on its own. I am using a t-mobile LG G4 H811 20i
57a09ca35623ed09ff6db90f;1000x better This is 1000x better than the old and dusty, outdated ROM Toolbox. Only thing that doesn't work is that the settings should be reapplied after reboot.
57a09ca35623ed09ff6db910;Very Interesting. I don't have use for it right now, but I can recommend it.
57a09ca35623ed09ff6db911;Nothing new Just a good interface and some old features
57a09ca75623ed09ff6db912;Good but.. There are no read ahead values between 1k and 2k at all,For some devices these kind of read a heads (like 1200) is needed for both I/O stability and performance, Please consider adding more read ahead values.
57a09ca75623ed09ff6db913;Needs updated Settings don't stick on reboot.
57a09ca75623ed09ff6db914;Galaxy Note 2 4.4.2 Kitkat What I really needed it was to modify the speed of processors and it makes perfect: processor / governor / perfomance. Thank you guys :)

57a09ca95623ed09ff6db916;Nice, but... It does not save the changes made in 'Filesystem' and it does not let me change the frequencies. Please fix this.
57a09ca95623ed09ff6db917;Ok.. Just amazing Absolutely fantastic. Download this app :)
57a09ca95623ed09ff6db918;Amazing Clean, simple, does everything it says it will. It's unfortunate people who have no idea what the app is for give you less stars for their own confusion. Thanks for the great app.

57a09cae5623ed09ff6db925;My phone has no root?!? It says, "this app cannot fully work without a rooted device." THIS APP IS A ROOT!! (facepalm)
57a09cae5623ed09ff6db926;This is the number one app for ROOT This is an excellent device even for the novice with a rooted device such as myself. The governor modifications, kernel tweaks, and Tasker are excellent and really help my device preform.

57a09cda5623ed09ff6db93f;Very good, can be better. Very good app, with the right information on tap. Appropriate level of information in notification. I would suggest the following improvements to this already good app: 1. Add option to show CPU clock speed in notification like 'CPU info' by Irelav. 2. Add capability to measure battery current (charging & discharging). Keep up the good work.

57a09cdd5623ed09ff6db943;Awesome app, detailed, and love the CPU meter on the notification bar. I've been using it on multiple systems for years.
57a09cdd5623ed09ff6db944;Monitor Great app thanks
57a09cdd5623ed09ff6db945;a-mazing Just what I needed, and good job on the root privileges, nice addition!
57a09cde5623ed09ff6db946;Nice Very useful app :)
57a09cde5623ed09ff6db947;Love it Must have, but sometimes a bit slow, because eats much itself.
57a09cde5623ed09ff6db948;Great App
57a09cde5623ed09ff6db949;Best to identify memory and cpu hogging apps 5 star! Ui update would be nice.
57a09cde5623ed09ff6db94a;Used to work quite well But now it shows nothing.
57a09ce35623ed09ff6db94b;FAILS to work! Fails to work every time that I try starting it...with it instead just showing zeros for nearly everything. I've inquired with them several times about it, yet they've never responded. I'm rooted, and ALL other similar process-related Apps work correctly such as 3D Process Monitor, so why won't this one work???! VERY DISAPPOINTING! (NOTE: This App ONLY fails like this when its settings are set for it to "Enable Root Privilege", otherwise it works okay. It is "Granted" root but repeatedly keeps asking!)
57a09ce35623ed09ff6db94c;Great tool. Thank you to the author.
57a09ce35623ed09ff6db94d;Usefull Helpfull for monitoring my android Operating System
57a09ce65623ed09ff6db94e;One tough app Had wicked hack went through Google and Samsung apps like tissue your app and couple others only thing keeping me sane corrupted the app in the end but not before I got a look at what was real thanks for being there
57a09ce65623ed09ff6db94f;Not compatible with android N update Shows everything you need to see what your phone is doing. With older versions of the os but nothing working after os update.
57a09ce65623ed09ff6db950;Open Source AND Ad Free! Great system monitor. Plus points in my book for being open source and ad free!
57a09cea5623ed09ff6db951;Excellent..... Shows CPU usage, Free memory and Battery üîã information on the notification area, and detailed information on opening the app. Does exactly what it says, and does that nicely.
57a09cea5623ed09ff6db952;Well Designed Love the app. I always wanted lightweight monitoring tool. It does pretty well job, but I can't able to see memory usage.
57a09cea5623ed09ff6db953;Lost of time , nothing working
57a09cea5623ed09ff6db954;Not identifying misbehaving app This app shows the system using all of the time, but it should be identifying the app which is calling the system for services. That's the app which is misbehaving, not the system itself.
57a09cec5623ed09ff6db955;A very well designed app. Only requires 1.6 mb to install it.
57a09cec5623ed09ff6db956;Awesome app! In addition to being a great system monitor, this app brought to my attention that a supposedly trustworthy app was actually contacting Beijing on a regular basis.
57a09cec5623ed09ff6db957;Very good, all users sould have it to see what apps really consume cpu. Keep updating please.
57a09cec5623ed09ff6db958;GOOD PHONE. MONITOR NICE!
57a09cec5623ed09ff6db959;Some Issues ... Make run at startup optional.
57a09ced5623ed09ff6db95a;nice helped me identify apps slowing down my phone
57a09ced5623ed09ff6db95b;Great for finding bloatware apps and other memory hogs, and apps that connect to the internet for no reason. Best tool I've found so far for this purpose.
57a09ced5623ed09ff6db95c;Good Nice but smll problem
57a09cf65623ed09ff6db95d;Good but notification not visible in 6.0 Since I got android 6.0 installed, marshmallow, the selected color don't show on the notification and since the frame is dark, and the dark colored graduating bars are dark too instead of light blue, and all is showing on a transparent notification bar where the image under it is dark, I can't see it at all. 5/7/2016 Nothing about this issue was addressed, so one star now.
57a09cf85623ed09ff6db95e;Very good app untill Google released Android N beta This app doesn't work with Android N beta
57a09cf85623ed09ff6db95f;Good but.. Show 0 processes if root privileges is ticked. Please fix!
57a09cf85623ed09ff6db960;Hands down. Amazing App! I was having major battery drain issues. Using OS monitor, I was able to narrow it down to Google Play Services. I turned off sync location and all of a sudden CPU usage dropped to nothing. Upon restarting location services, CPU usage stayed low. But once I re-enabled sync I saw CPU usage jump back up to ~20%. That's when I knew where my issue was. I would have been lost without this app!
57a09cf85623ed09ff6db961;Samsung SM-T210R Awesome..............
57a09cfa5623ed09ff6db962;Great App. This is an extremely well-developed app, & free w/no ads. Hope to see a couple more features added in the future, but I highly recommend it. Permanent part of my phone toolkit now. Thanks!
57a09cfa5623ed09ff6db963;Very detailed stats Everything you would expect from a System Monitor.
57a09cfa5623ed09ff6db964;Bon et assez complet
57a09cfa5623ed09ff6db965;Does what it says. It's an absolute godsend.
57a09cfa5623ed09ff6db966;Very usefull It is very good app . show all system usefull info , but it should have option for end app or force close.
57a09cff5623ed09ff6db967;ipv6 support When i click ipv6 ip adresses it just shows nothing
57a09cff5623ed09ff6db968;Love it!
57a09cff5623ed09ff6db969;Fairly complete, fairly great (going to look if there is something better, thus MORE searching for a decent APP, or confirming that this is about as good as it gets - grrr). Gripes (thus reason to again search for better tool): 1.) The Settings have no defaults set. 2.) CPU Usage in Notification Area (which can be turned off) is fairly useless (and the Pulldown version has few choices), because it's not so great overall disabling - thus that 'Feature' is no use (to ME), so that's gone. 3.) Should have Settings Toggle to remove itself (and Android Process) from Listings. 4.) No hide for specific Process. 5.) Back Button easily EXITS, instead of going back. Otherwise 6 STARS ! - Does many things, a few poorly.
57a09d015623ed09ff6db96a;Great tool? Which one? Please reply! But doesn't Android assistant show processes at least as well, and in fact with more info, like memory use? Dismissing it's other features, as they are irrelevant when comparing process monitoring - I'd like to know, what does OS Monitor have over, or do better than Android assistants process monitor? I'm making choice between the two.
57a09d015623ed09ff6db96b;My favourite app which my phone can't live without. The 1st app I install after ROM/phone change. Cpu notification is not visible under marshmallow?
57a09d015623ed09ff6db96c;Perfect
57a09d015623ed09ff6db96d;Great. Thanks
57a09d035623ed09ff6db96e;very useful!
57a09d035623ed09ff6db96f;Excellent Especially the temperature reading.
57a09d035623ed09ff6db970;That should be standard in stock Android. One has the right to know what is running (and juicing battery) on his own phone.
57a09d035623ed09ff6db971;Great app!
57a09d035623ed09ff6db972;Good I like it, can you add cpu temperature to it too? Could have it on the persistent notification like the battery one? Would be really useful for me :) 5* if it's done :D
57a09d075623ed09ff6db973;Great app. Thanks !
57a09d075623ed09ff6db974;Malware got into my house last week (over a $%^ XP laptop). It seems to have gotten onto my phone (*OR* "TrustLook" is malware itself). Using OS Monitor, I actually saw an active connection to a server in China. This software is incredible. I refuse to let anything financial happen on my phone, but if you show us a web site where we can donate, I think you might get much more of a rewarding response from your users.....
57a09d075623ed09ff6db975;Simple.
57a09d075623ed09ff6db976;Good Simply good app! :)
57a09d095623ed09ff6db977;Perfect Excellent tool for getting insight on what apps are (not) performing
57a09d095623ed09ff6db978;Stopped working completely after last version. Stopped working completely after last version.
57a09d095623ed09ff6db979;Nice free app with notification bar icon! Although I would prefer this app to show both CPU usage and memory usage AT THE SAME TIME, such as another app named "System Monitor Lite". Besides, that app has much better UI.
57a09d0b5623ed09ff6db97a;Works well... More concerned about the program's own overlay on the system, more than all program's together... On Moto 3G 3rd gen with 1gb ram prog needs more resources than whole system... Do I miss something? Please advise
57a09d0b5623ed09ff6db97b;New SuperSU breaks root functionality Updated SuperSU and this now shows no info. Unticked the option (in OSMonitor) to use root, and it works, but I can't terminate a cpu-thug app as root anymore.
57a09d0b5623ed09ff6db97c;Excellent Just what i needed to control my device better!
57a09d0b5623ed09ff6db97d;Useful app
57a09d0d5623ed09ff6db97e;Exactly what I needed.
57a09d0d5623ed09ff6db97f;Tells me what processes use the cpu The phone was warm this morning. This app tells me what process was using the CPU.
57a09d0d5623ed09ff6db980;Pretty useful
57a09d0d5623ed09ff6db981;Just what I needed Perfect app to find out what is eating up CPU and draining my battery.
57a09d0d5623ed09ff6db982;Helpful app Gives you all the vital info about your phone!!!
57a09d0f5623ed09ff6db983;Problem with root enabled Good app, but stops working (doesn't show any info) when root is enabled in its options. I hope that will be fixed soon. BTW, what should be the benefit of having root enabled.
57a09d0f5623ed09ff6db984;I love this apps
57a09d0f5623ed09ff6db985;Equivalent to task manager of windows Hands-down a must-hav for power users...
57a09d135623ed09ff6db986;One of the best "Help" pages ever (touch the "i" button), makes this a real winner. What seems confusing in the app, is explained simply on web page. MORE Apps need this sort of support home page. [At first glance interface seems confusing, BUT TOUCH "i" button which brings to "Help" page: This explains everythinng VERY clearly in seconds.] App does a really good job of portraying system usage info, both instantaneous, and aggregate. Particularly good connections mapping info. Less of a power hog than many apps that provide similar features. Definitely worth a try. [Dev consider arrow keys to move between regular and expert pages/screens: "tools" key confusing to some/many.
57a09d135623ed09ff6db987;Excellent Friendly UI and lots of information. I really like the ability to see where my apps are phoning home too . Of course Google and Facebook are the usual offenders but you may be surprised what you find.
57a09d165623ed09ff6db988;A must have This is a must have app in my opinion. It shows you all your apps and what they are up to (hardware usage and Internet usage.) I also appreciate the developer(s) for making this advertisement free and it doesn't need crazy permissions.
57a09d165623ed09ff6db989;This is exactly what I want! But I googled and finally ended up with this app. Now I can get rid of the CPU hogging app. Great job! The UI is not as awful as those screenshots listed in the description. But this app is laggy while tapping on items listed.
57a09d165623ed09ff6db98a;The GUI could really do with an overhaul, also since the latest SU update, doesn't seem to work. Tried a few things (rebooting etc.), but all other root apps work fine. Just this one.
57a09d175623ed09ff6db98b;Excellent
57a09d175623ed09ff6db98c;Nice and ad clear Very handy utility, ads-free
57a09d175623ed09ff6db98d;Great App! Allowed me to track down an app that was bringing my phone to a crawl. The culprit, believe it or not, was Cisco WebEx Meeting. Can't believe an app from a major software developer like that would be causing an issue. But I uninstalled it and problem was instantly gone. Thanks OS Monitor devs.
57a09d175623ed09ff6db98e;Please don't install this app... this app potential problem network... when opened logmsg my network is lose and my phone can't registered to network... many time try and unstll this app is normal back... when I instll again this problem back... whatt this?
57a09d1a5623ed09ff6db98f;Running on Priv by BlackBerry Out of most the system utility apps I have tried I keep coming back to this one.. It seems most accurate, it has helped me to find certain apps that go overboard using CPU and let's me know when my phones getting warm.. Really all that's missing is a better battery usage monitor than the stock android.. Maybe some graphs
57a09d1a5623ed09ff6db990;Stopped working Works after fresh install or dalvik / cache wipe. Second launch nope no data. (0 processes nothing on the other tabs as well. )
57a09d1d5623ed09ff6db991;I don't understand why Android doesn't have a native app to accomplish what this great app does. My LG G4 was hot all the time since I upgraded to Marshmallow and I didn't know why. It was seriously draining my battery (instead of lasting 12 hours, it lasted like 2). Then I installed this app and saw that Accuweather was running all the time using 20% CPU. I uninstalled Accuweather and now my G4 works again like a charm. Thank you very much developer!
57a09d1d5623ed09ff6db992;Good tool Mem monitor in Notifications. That's good.
57a09d1d5623ed09ff6db993;Superb app Love it. The only thing missing is a 'select all' option in top menu when killing apps with trash can. Also an option to go to Android app settings to Disable or Uninstall when you long press on a single process.
57a09d1e5623ed09ff6db994;I always use this! I love how it shows geolocations on network connections to help me monitor my devices
57a09d1e5623ed09ff6db995;Just till I figure this out and see if it works or not
57a09d1e5623ed09ff6db996;Question? What is the message board on it? I'm not a computer wizard only using it for seeing which apps are draining. But there are thousands of messages coming up
57a09d1e5623ed09ff6db997;Very useful app There are other ones but this one is solid
57a09d1e5623ed09ff6db998;Great for testing new cell carriers
57a09d205623ed09ff6db999;Good But can not kill crashed apps even if root is granted. 20160113: In Lollipop, the CPU usage is not shown until a few seconds have elapsed.
57a09d205623ed09ff6db99a;The best of its type.
57a09d205623ed09ff6db99b;Great Help me solve a rebooting problem (deserves donation)
57a09d205623ed09ff6db99c;Iman Best app tnx
57a09d205623ed09ff6db99d;Trustable? Android system was 196% when locking???. Lol.
57a09d215623ed09ff6db99e;Excellent application
57a09d215623ed09ff6db99f;Handy Very useful thankyou. Would be nice to see a ram usage as well as CPU ‚Ä∞ to save having to use the android monitor separately.
57a09d215623ed09ff6db9a0;Light theme Light theme for notification would be better with Android 5+.
57a09d215623ed09ff6db9a1;Nice work
57a09d215623ed09ff6db9a2;Very detailed system monitor to see what service/app/connection is doing what.
57a09d245623ed09ff6db9a3;Perfect usage monitor Provides all the functionality of a system process monitor. I wanted to identify which program was hogging the system resources, and this little program very clearly shows the average usage of each process for a given time internal.
57a09d245623ed09ff6db9a4;muy buena aplicacion la recomiendo mucho
57a09d245623ed09ff6db9a5;Nice app! Really like the notification bar widget, so I can instantly see what's hogging up the cpu.
57a09d245623ed09ff6db9a6;Nice!
57a09d275623ed09ff6db9a7;Awesome App! Wouldn't want to use Android without it.
57a09d275623ed09ff6db9a8;Android memory management is a thing of beauty. This is the perfect app to watch the show.
57a09d275623ed09ff6db9a9;Notification Shows White Bars Again In Marshmallow.
57a09d275623ed09ff6db9aa;I don't know what happen (solved) Hi. I like your app, and i currently using my z5. I'm having a problem, i cannot tick the autostart option in Settings, but in my other device (galaxy tab s2 and xperia z1) i can autostart, can U help me solve this problem? All of my devices is on 5.1.1, thx :) (problem solved: do not move your apps to sd card)
57a09d2b5623ed09ff6db9ab;The best bundle Everything i wanted! Low cpu usage, exit button, amazing tasks that no other app could do! Even a nice log! Thank you developer! You're great!
57a09d2b5623ed09ff6db9ac;CPU and RAM use It's useful being able to see the top three items that are using cpu time from the notification bar.
57a09d2b5623ed09ff6db9ad;Monitoring tool rocks Now I feel a little more in control...Thanks for the great work üëç
57a09d2d5623ed09ff6db9ae;Ace I will give it a 5 for all the information it gives you understanding it though is a different story lol
57a09d2d5623ed09ff6db9af;Exactly what I wanted : A way to monitor the behavior of every app !
57a09d2d5623ed09ff6db9b0;Excellent!
57a09d2d5623ed09ff6db9b1;You won't be able to monitorize anything The info of will be tricky to monitorize because the info is info is moving all time and will be very hard to check it even when you click on it. So I suggest to fix it and I will give 5* otherwise blah
57a09d2f5623ed09ff6db9b2;Find that killer app This app helped me realize the apps not just eating CPU, but allocating RAM for background resources. C
57a09d2f5623ed09ff6db9b3;Great The only one I've found that shows details about network connections, precious if you suspect malware or similar
57a09d2f5623ed09ff6db9b4;Unreliable Reports lower CPU usage than is actually being used.
57a09d2f5623ed09ff6db9b5;Excellent
57a09d315623ed09ff6db9b6;No more real-time CPU load notification Turns out the problem is only with MIUI 7. CM12.1 doesn't have this issue. So I re-rate it a 4 stars. Thanks.
57a09d315623ed09ff6db9b7;It's good but a bit slow It's good but a bit slow on my moto xt910. I like the notification area quick info. Also the settings are a bit confusing.
57a09d365623ed09ff6db9b8;Would be great, except... Would be the best task manager, except the kill-process function doesn't work correctly for many processes (e.g. Wunderlist). Instead of killing it and keeping it killed, the process starts back up again! Other task-killers, e.g. ZDBox, keep the process dead as expected. EDIT: Found out command that keeps process dead (tested in terminal as root, and it works). Instead of calling "kill [pid]", call: "am force-stop [package name]" Can the developer please add this command as a second button, such as "force-stop package"? It would make it a lot more powerful as a task killer.
57a09d365623ed09ff6db9b9;like this app this app like the resmon in windows.but with message
57a09d365623ed09ff6db9ba;Worked perfectly on 5.1, does not work on 6.0. HTC m8 GPE
57a09d3b5623ed09ff6db9bb;Great Task/Service Monitor
57a09d3b5623ed09ff6db9bc;REQUEST to DEV I gave a 5 star review on my acoustic music profile so I'm using my alternative profile to ask you if there is any way you can implement a feature that the app NETWORK CONNECTIONS has by way of when you click on an active connection you can ALSO see if any ABUSERS are using that particular Isp. It says RBL Abusers and some apps use dodgy ISPs that are used in data mining etc. I prefer your OS app so can you implement that feature ? Kindest, Stephanie
57a09d3e5623ed09ff6db9bd;Excellent troubleshooting app for slowdowns. Want to know exactly what process is running in the background, chewing up cpu cycles? This app has bailed me out many times. Just open it, see what is using the CPU, then go to your settings/apps and remove the offending program. It's pretty straightforward and VERY useful.
57a09d3e5623ed09ff6db9be;I vl b giving 5 stars when the graph is in white lines previous version notification graph with white line was better!
57a09d425623ed09ff6db9bf;I like this app and I've found it quite useful already. I do want to have a legend for the connection status though. What does listen mean? It only shows up for Facebook and messenger
57a09d425623ed09ff6db9c0;Great app, been using for years After this last update I can no longer change the color of the notification icon. It's black so if my notification bar is black I can't see it unless I pull down the bar itself. Please fix this or at least make it green or blue again. EDIT: After restarting, the notification doesn't work. Just shows "click to start OS Monitor". Also doesn't show processes anymore in the app and It's constantly showing the pop up that it has been granted root permission now too. Using a Samsung SM-T800 stock 5.0.2 rooted. EDIT: Response and fix in less than 24 hours! Great devs and great app!
57a09d445623ed09ff6db9c1;Very useful
57a09d445623ed09ff6db9c2;Great tool I've been using for years, always better.
57a09d445623ed09ff6db9c3;A must-have It's the first app I install on a new phone, and the first thing I recommend to friends.
57a09e255623ed0a0ffead00;Been using it for years It's got all the features I want and isn't horrible like the official app.
57a09e255623ed0a0ffead01;User Friendly Have been using this application for a couple years, but most recently discovered how easy it is to download wherigo cartridges, bonus!!!
57a09e255623ed0a0ffead02;The best Geocaching app available This app is so great that even if I didn't like android (I love it though) I still would never go to iPhone just because they don't have this app. I am still learning features I didn't even know existed on it and each time those features make geocaching even more efficient and easier to do. Easily my favorite.
57a09e275623ed0a0ffead03;Excellent Does everything you need it to do flawlessly. Possibly better than the official app.
57a09e275623ed0a0ffead04;Great App. Works great!
57a09e275623ed0a0ffead05;Best cache app and free Been using this on a old phone and it works fantastic. Only thing I miss is a way to translate text directly in the app using something like Google translate
57a09e275623ed0a0ffead06;Simple, useful Very easy to use
57a09e285623ed0a0ffead07;Gps For some reason the GPS is no longer correctly pointing my arrow where it should. I have checked every button and function to fix this and there is not one available.
57a09e285623ed0a0ffead08;Great app, easy to use! I use this app whenever I am out and about. Great for that quick geocache craving!
57a09e285623ed0a0ffead09;Still the best app out there.
57a09e285623ed0a0ffead0a;It won't log my finds
57a09e285623ed0a0ffead0b;Best there is Good app
57a09e2a5623ed0a0ffead0c;Working app, amazing :D
57a09e2a5623ed0a0ffead0d;Use it all the time Great app. Does everything I need except actually finding the cache for me!
57a09e2a5623ed0a0ffead0e;The best geocaching app I've used this app for years. It does absolutely everything you need for geo caching. This app does not arbitrarily mark caches above a 1.5 difficulty rating as premium. This is the app you want.
57a09e2a5623ed0a0ffead0f;Noob love I'm so new to geocaching that I haven't even found my first one yet. I tried one app but couldn't use it to figure out what I was looking for. Checked this one out for goggles and voila now I know what to go back and look for! Hoodathunkit
57a09e2c5623ed0a0ffead10;Great community alternative Ui is very functional but great to have a free community alternative to the official geocaching app.
57a09e2c5623ed0a0ffead11;Really good Works great! Sometimes crashes on my s3 but it is great otherwise. Would definantly recommend this app!
57a09e2c5623ed0a0ffead12;Compare and see By far the best app for mobile geocaching
57a09e2c5623ed0a0ffead13;Have to pay Completely useless withoutpremium app
57a09e2c5623ed0a0ffead14;Love this app, works for my needs
57a09e2d5623ed0a0ffead15;Only geocaching app we use. We don't even use a GPS anymore.
57a09e2d5623ed0a0ffead16;Its not giving me a live map and i cant figure out why
57a09e2d5623ed0a0ffead17;UX can be improved
57a09e2d5623ed0a0ffead18;The latest update is great, thanks for the continued support of this app. It has so far outperformed the official app in almost every area. Going to give the android wear utility a try as soon as I get the chance.
57a09e315623ed0a0ffead19;Slow Even using offline map, renders slowly. Bug with Personal Note feature, with larger note will often duplicate the text, with double hyphen in between. Which is annoying. Wish the X and checkmark buttons were farther apart, tapping on X by mistake if not really careful. Still has the best features, but I use the other 2 apps (official and GCDroid) as well, especially for the live maps.
57a09e315623ed0a0ffead1a;Hide premium option? Great app! My favourite but haven't used it for a few years. Installed again and the results are peppered with premium caches. Wish there was an option to tick so that premium caches are hidden from the map/results. I don't geocache enough to warrant premium membership so guess I have to make do with messy search results.... =(
57a09e315623ed0a0ffead1b;Cool
57a09e325623ed0a0ffead1c;The app seems to have stopped working and doesn't display any caches. Is this a common problem?
57a09e325623ed0a0ffead1d;Best geocache app Still the best geocache app around.
57a09e325623ed0a0ffead1e;Won't let me log in
57a09e325623ed0a0ffead1f;Best app available! This is definitely the best app out there for geocaching. The only thing I dislike is how long it takes to update which caches I have found. Also, it occasionally shows premium caches even though I am not a premium member.
57a09e345623ed0a0ffead20;I prefer this over the official geocach app. Great live map!
57a09e345623ed0a0ffead21;Geocaching FTW This app is fantastic! When we get a "bouncy compass" because of the GPS coordinates, we get the best results by using two or more phone to narrow down the area.
57a09e345623ed0a0ffead22;Great app Had a lot of fun with this :-)
57a09e345623ed0a0ffead23;Love all the easy logging options Caching is MUCH easier with this app. Just need to be able to rotate the map and track up.
57a09e345623ed0a0ffead24;Lovin it
57a09e355623ed0a0ffead25;Having fun with it
57a09e355623ed0a0ffead26;Makes geocaching easy. Thank you Awesome app. Almost never has a problem
57a09e355623ed0a0ffead27;Great geocaching app. The more you get into it, the better it is.
57a09e395623ed0a0ffead28;Great app!! I have been using this app to cache for years. Even when I quit for a while, it still kept a home on my phone. This app lets you enjoy your hobby spontaneously and is feature rich. The few things I could complain about have just been fixed. If you are a cacher, give this app a shot. You will be happy you did. Any chance you can bring out a version for the Samsung Gear smart watch?
57a09e395623ed0a0ffead29;Can't log finds I love this app for finding caches but I can never log finds from phone have to wait and do it on computer. I've lost a few logs because of it, it's really frustrating.
57a09e395623ed0a0ffead2a;Simply the best! Used this app for many years when it was run by carnaro and it is still the best! Love it! If you rate this app 4* or 5* consider donating to keep the app alive!
57a09e3b5623ed0a0ffead2b;Great ! Now works great !
57a09e3b5623ed0a0ffead2c;I love this app. Unlike the other app I tried, this got me so close to the cache that I felt like I was cheating. I can locate nearby caches, find them and log my find all from this app and while still in the field.
57a09e3b5623ed0a0ffead2d;Very useful app Works well. Saving caches offline is great feature. Works well with openstreetmaps.
57a09e3b5623ed0a0ffead2e;Mixed review This was a fantastic app and still works great on my Samsung Note 4. However, it refuses to log in on my Samsung Fame. Initially it was ok but now it refuses to. I've tried everything, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app, all to no avail. Not happy.
57a09e3e5623ed0a0ffead2f;Best Geocaching alternative app! The app is amazing. It let's you access every cache, regardless of whether you are a premium member or not! The only thing that I would suggest is a more elegant material design (so that it doesn't look like Android 4) and the ability to describe your log with "found it" and etc.
57a09e3e5623ed0a0ffead30;love this app! takes a while to load but thats probably just my phone/network.
57a09e3e5623ed0a0ffead31;Everything good but... Material design and messaging would be nice. Also, the fact that we have to place (offline) maps on the internal storage sucks. It's not as if this would be that hard... NOTE: Samsung Galaxy S5 user may check the "force orientation senser" box in settings, system. Results in a compass that's less over the place.
57a09e405623ed0a0ffead32;The best.. Hands down, the best Geo App..
57a09e405623ed0a0ffead33;Better than the official app
57a09e405623ed0a0ffead34;Very usefull but fter last update there is a problem After the last update the distance is wrong. Expecting the length of the GC it comes up with the distance from where i am now. We would like both. But please keep the info the same as the official site! It does make my geocaching indeed paperless. But it could do with some improvements. But if all is loaded and stored it works fine during the hunt.. Thanks
57a09e405623ed0a0ffead35;Great geocatching app
57a09e415623ed0a0ffead36;Great Good app but the captcha images are too small to make out when I'm out and about.
57a09e415623ed0a0ffead37;Better than the official app
57a09e415623ed0a0ffead38;Pretty good It is good but i can't figure out how to get to the compass and it should come with something that tells you if you are getting closer or not
57a09e415623ed0a0ffead39;Fun Something to do with the family and friends
57a09e435623ed0a0ffead3a;So good This app is the one that the official app should be trying to beat. The official app has a money grabbing subscription that is not worth it.
57a09e435623ed0a0ffead3b;Powerful As usually happens with open source programs, this app is perfect, has a lot useful features and makes the Geocaching experience better!
57a09e435623ed0a0ffead3c;Great app This app is free and great! Has a few bugs but once you figure out how to use it well it works great
57a09e435623ed0a0ffead3d;The definitive Geocaching app!
57a09e455623ed0a0ffead3e;GPS ISSUES Looks great but as I'm in Wales, it tells me I'm in Paris. Whats going on there then!!!!
57a09e455623ed0a0ffead3f;Outstanding and then some Great app!
57a09e455623ed0a0ffead40;Same issues Still a great app with same issues on new phone. First time I clicked a pdf or an mp3 cgeo launched.
57a09e455623ed0a0ffead41;Still the best, bar none! The only app I ever donated to! This app is awesome! If you rate it 4* or 5*, then donate a little, to keep the app alive!
57a09e465623ed0a0ffead42;Great App Have been using this app all week while on holidays and it is awesome. Love how you have a full change log as well.
57a0a13c5623ed0bd06d2b6d;Great This app saved my quest for WiFi ADB a lot of times.
57a0a13c5623ed0bd06d2b6e;easy to use, Android Shell Terminal
57a0a13c5623ed0bd06d2b6f;So great, I even managed to build a $HOME/.profile loaded by calling 'exec sh -l'... and to $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" ' &gt;&gt; $HOME/.profile...
57a0a13c5623ed0bd06d2b70;Cannot send special keys
57a0a13c5623ed0bd06d2b71;I gave 3 star as soon as I downloaded this app

57a0a1415623ed0bd06d2b7e;Works as expected, darned useful Works like you would expect a terminal to, on a mobile Android device. Damnned useful! Highly recommend this.

57a0a15a5623ed0bd06d2bca;Good but... There's a huge gap when I type commands like the space gap
57a0a15d5623ed0bd06d2bcb;Partly insulting The app is perfectly fine. I have had it for 5 minutes and am satisfied. But as a true developer, the words "Unleash your inner geek" is slightly insulting. Please change that. Another thing, a couple of commands that ARE in other Linux computers like Debian are missing like nano from Android. I believe you should add an alias for it because people will think that you did not "make" things like that
57a0a15d5623ed0bd06d2bcc;mantap
57a0a15d5623ed0bd06d2bcd;Very useful. Although, I think the language is difficult but I guess it's irrelevant. It's just really hard to write on tiny touch-screen (just to show reality) but at least it can be used to fix files anywhere. To me, it's fine as it is; I like it lightweight.

57a0a1745623ed0bd06d2bf8;An essential bit of kit for when nothing but a nuts-and-bolts tty will do. Clever mapping of key modifiers to the hardware buttons makes the interface surprisingly practical in everyday use. I wouldn't want to use it for an extended shell session, but for those moments when you need quick access to the prompt, this (in combination with the Hacker's Keyboard) comes highly recommended.
57a0a1745623ed0bd06d2bf9;how do you run aptitude on it?
57a0a1745623ed0bd06d2bfa;Awesome app Works great
57a0a1745623ed0bd06d2bfb;Great little terminal A soft ui based toggle alternative to the hardware keys would be preferable as they are awkward to use other than that this is reliable and I enjoy using it. Thanks.

57a0a1a05623ed0bd06d2c5e;In response to not having a text editor-- that has nothing to do with the terminal emulator. if you're root Google how to install bash and nano :)

57a0a1a95623ed0bd06d2c77;Can not paste text. Really frustrated typing commands.
57a0a1ad5623ed0bd06d2c78;A wonderful discovery! It's come in handy for running simple commands but where it really shines, at least for me, are the key shortcuts and ability to set commands to execute immediately the terminal is started. I set "su" then "pkill mediaserver" since it quickly frees the mediaserver when trying to catch a moment on photo but camera can't because something else is engaging the server. It's all done so fast since I keep its icon in my notification bar (along a few others).
57a0a1ad5623ed0bd06d2c79;Great app
57a0a1ad5623ed0bd06d2c7a;Sucks This app wont even work. It doesnt even type.

57a0a1e75623ed0bd06d2cd4;its best ever. but we are not use window command .. but its work some common cammand.
57a0a1eb5623ed0bd06d2cd5;Good key mapping. Easy to use Tried a few terminal emus and I still think this one just works best when switching from desktop keyboard to phone keyboard. I can run htop and to quit just hold vol-dn + c. If I have to CD into some directory, vol-up + t for Tab. Of I want to run previous commands vol-up + w for up and vol-up + s for down. Also ssh, vim work well in here and can reliably work on remote servers from my phone in case of emergency. Hopefully I'll never have too though.
57a0a1eb5623ed0bd06d2cd6;Ecelentae It works just download wpa wps tester to hack wifi
57a0a1eb5623ed0bd06d2cd7;Nice Nice
57a0a1ee5623ed0bd06d2cd8;Simple yet powerful, i like the idea of having vol button as modifier, which we really need to simulate keyboard command.

57a0a1f15623ed0bd06d2ce0;Handy, but limited. Seems to do the trick for most mass file operations, but very limted network tools. Other apps can do the ping, tracert, netstat, nslookup, whois, finger etc. stuff more reliably, but can't then process and respond to the results. This could process results if it could get them... But it can't.

57a0a2335623ed0bd06d2d3c;Outstanding Software If it runs Linux it needs a terminal emulator. Look no further than this one.

57a0a2375623ed0bd06d2d3f;Android Root Must Have!! Allows rooted android custom ROMs to change your native resolutions from 4k to 1080p which will help battery life and avoid screen burns. You can also change pixel density as well aka PPI. Tips- first type: su then press enter. Then to change resolution from quad HD to 1080p type: wm size 1080x1920. To change pixel density type: wm density (PPI amount) ex. 420 for moto x pure or nexus 6 493 or note 5 518 etc. To reset resolution back to quad HD type: wm size reset. To reset PPI type: wm density reset.

57a101555623ed112dfbe304;Worked just fine for a long time until now and made me almost buy a new phone I used this app for a long time on my Asus Zenfone 5. About 1 month ago, mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly, the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes, makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app, because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers
57a101555623ed112dfbe305;Works well with pictures from SD Memory card too Good LWP slideshow. Samsung Galaxy S4 Active with Android 4.4.2
57a101555623ed112dfbe306;SD Card Doesn't see the memory card where comics are stored so useless to me.
57a101555623ed112dfbe307;Dual sim? Wouldn't it be more convenient if we can choose from which sim card we like to send our messages from? This app is still great, though, but only 4 stars for now.
57a101555623ed112dfbe308;Easy Install and Use! I'm a huge fan of Hangouts and use it on my Nexus as my main text app, desktop, laptop, and cell. So I doubted this product until I used it. Super easy to setup and use and works basically like Hangouts. Love it.

57a101555623ed112dfbe30b;A little bit inconsistent Doesn't work reliably with my GS7 edge. I wanted to turn off AOD and use this but it doesn't have an always on mode. Please consider adding
57a101555623ed112dfbe30c;My favorite app Update 11/4 Doesn't work on galaxy S5. Does not show multiple screens. I have tons of apps, but this one is fantastic. It uses little resources, does what it says, does it well and has all the controls you could possibly want. My only suggestion would be to have an option to combine all screens into a single wallpaper like the standard wallpaper only you get the interval change. It's a minor suggestion and should not take away form the app.
57a101555623ed112dfbe30d;When will you support dual sim texting? :( I can only give 4 stars because of it.
57a101555623ed112dfbe30e;Please add more features The app is very good but please add more features like changing texts size, support for dual sim devices, mark a message as not readed, and..., Thanks :)
57a101555623ed112dfbe30f;Ultimate Control Hahaha &gt,:) Just one last thing. Hope you guys get a peek on this suggestion of mine... In the App Manager when you tap on the app? Can you put a Move to SD Card and Vice Versa so i dont need to go to my settings ?
57a101555623ed112dfbe310;Its Ok The biggest drawback is the picture size limit. When I tried to send a picture it said that I was exceeding the size limit, but it was able to send perfectly fine through my normal text SMS app.
57a101555623ed112dfbe311;It's okay Just wish I could save so every time i died i didn't have to start all over
57a101555623ed112dfbe312;There should be a quick save option in my opnion that way if you have to stop plying you won't lose all your progress,and maybe even just a checkpoint that can be used once or something.

57a101555623ed112dfbe314;Great but... I'd like to give this app 5 stars but it makes unlock slower... On my Samsung Galaxy S6, I have to swipe and then unlock with fingerprints, of you add fingerprint directly in acdisplay I'll give you 5 stars ! You can also add a mode for Samsung clear cover ,)
57a101555623ed112dfbe315;Great app....! But the major change has to be do is that the floating shortcut doesn't appeare as soon as text is been coppied on clipboard and the thing which has to be done is firstly we have to pull down the notification tray and then after putting it back the floating shortcut appeares and also the bubble short cut is insecure while using banking apps so I would rate app as 5 star only when you people will develop an app of such a form that app will not ask acesseblity permission.
57a101565623ed112dfbe316;list item take too much space, missing info 1) Each list item is surrounded by too much empty space. List view could have been easily compressed more. 2) In list view, I want to see full time ( not just month & day, & year if not current). 3) Sometimes Amaze seems to fail to recall options set previously.
57a101565623ed112dfbe317;Annoying bar Top bar takes too much space. I can't disable it because I need it's functionality‚Ä¶
57a101565623ed112dfbe318;meh Too much wasted space. No control over text size. I'm using a phone with a decent size screen (5.5 inch) and in landscape there is so much space wasted only two files are visible. Noy very useful with such a limitation.
57a101565623ed112dfbe319;Widgets Small widget doesn't work in android 6.0 LG G3. I mean it doesn't show untrained words.
57a101565623ed112dfbe31a;Does exactly what it says Does exactly what it says....low footprint widget. I wanted a very big widget so I could monitor the battery.
57a101565623ed112dfbe31b;It works well and I'm learning but doesn't seem to display the third tone in pinyin correctly. Also you should be able to scroll at the left and use the whiteboard on the right. This will make it easier to practice writing while checking notes.
57a101565623ed112dfbe31c;Great design! One of the best spaced repetition apps out there. Very well-designed. I only wish it were easier to switch between multiple profiles! I use the app with my students in class as well as for my own studies. And it proves it to be very difficult to do that on the same device.
57a101565623ed112dfbe31d;CAPCHA Whilst I have no issue with you including this feature can you please try to implement it more effectively? I have a Note 4 and even on that large, hi res screen those capchas are ridiculously hard to read.
57a101565623ed112dfbe31e;There is transfers! Click on the red button when you set a new transaction. Quite hidden, but it's there!
57a101565623ed112dfbe31f;Keeps crashing Since I upgraded my android this game keeps crashing.
57a101565623ed112dfbe320;Drains my battery! This drains my battery. I can't deactivate this. I get a message saying an administrator must do it. IT'S MY PHONE. Is there a way to delete this app?
57a101565623ed112dfbe321;For excellent power saving.... The sexiest and hottest lockscreen ever If u experience lot of battery drain or u want that sexy and hot look on ur phone then install this app.
57a101565623ed112dfbe322;Great app! just wondering if you could implement an 'always on' display that uses low battery for AMOLED display users
57a101565623ed112dfbe323;Great app This app is very good to keep up your battery.
57a101565623ed112dfbe324;Like it! Used battery not for years. Simply appreciate and great to know exactly what the status of the battery is right on the home screen.
57a101565623ed112dfbe325;Simple and lightweight Does what I wanted and that's just to show my remaining battery life in a percentage while being light on memory usage.
57a101565623ed112dfbe326;Moto X I've had this app on 3other phones which all done the job well. Low memory, simple, no ads. Life is good. Thanks app makers. Highly recommended...
57a101565623ed112dfbe327;memory drain used to be great
57a101565623ed112dfbe328;Fix please. So on other file manager if i open very large like conf file ex:apns config on /system/etc . then it not LAGS. Im using exynos note 3 btw. And in yours and some other it lags so much. Cant even scroll to bottom. Maybe allocate more ram? Or use all threads available? And remember hardware rendering :) great job btw. Best file manager
57a101565623ed112dfbe329;Functions Broken The 'move'option has been completely removed with only the choice to 'cut', but even when copying and pasting folders in my storage, it crashes and only copies half or less the files. Please fix.
57a101565623ed112dfbe32a;Good design very easy to use Working flawlessly on my S5 for a couple of days now,always showing in the notification bar and it hasn't missed a beat,great performance even during heavy multitasking it has no negative impact on system resources,it has the right amount of functionality and usability it needs while keeping it fast and simple still
57a101565623ed112dfbe32b;Used to be great Now stuck at 99% and phones own indicator shows true value. Pain as rely on it and ended up with no battery yesterday...
57a101565623ed112dfbe32c;GREATEST APP EVA Accurate does not take much space! GOOD JOB!!!!!:):):):):):
57a101565623ed112dfbe32d;5Stars and highest donation 1) I don't only contact developers when having a problem or a request with an application, I also do so when being seriously impressed, which are the case with your 'ClipStack' application. This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation, but only to support you, not to unlock extra features, as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply, you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: 'Make it work, but keep it simple', which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available. Respect for you 'guys'. I will of course rate you on Google play store.  Yasemin Nielsen, Denmark/Norway
57a101565623ed112dfbe32e;Great This is the best free twitter client, if you're not willing to pay the 4.49 for Fenix. Easy to use, keep up the great work Chris Lacy!
57a101565623ed112dfbe32f;What's the point? I willing 'donated' $5 thinking I would unlock some extra content, or even the option to SAVE my progress. This is a fun FREE game, but I genuinely do feel cheated out of my money. Bottom line, fun game but not worth the $5 as there is no added content /value.
57a101565623ed112dfbe330;Loved it... A few suggestions... Try making this... Plz remove the item degrading features... It's kinda Annoying... That's all... Also I would not kill you even if u add some adds. Make it so that u get enough money to keep updating and donations remove adds. That would surely help u bring more content. But don't do too much adds. Just the right amount.... :)
57a101565623ed112dfbe331;Best movie and TV show tracker app out there! Love this app, I use it daily! Also includes the option of going to premium for a one-time payment and not monthly payments like most of the other similar apps.
57a101565623ed112dfbe332;Nice Nice, except paid app for battery charge alarm
57a101565623ed112dfbe333;Actually very excellent! It works great, it's light weight. There is no hidden spyware or Malware like no wifi disconnect, no picture takers, no direct phone calling without your knowledge. This is truly a sweet app. I will buy the paid version just because the writer of this app is so honest...
57a101565623ed112dfbe334;I figured out a way to calibrate it! Take a piece of foam larger than your phone/tablet. (I used 1' Styrofoam insulation) Float the foam in a bowl or your sink full of water. Place your phone on top of the foam and wait until it stops moving.......press calibrate. It should be fairly accurate at that point. I have a Samsung S2x with a battery that bulges out at the back and it was the only way I could figure out how to get level with it. Simple but useful app. Thanks. Edit- Decided to buy the 'Pro Version' Worth the $2 (Canadian :-) )
57a101565623ed112dfbe335;Works great. Well designed and secure. Wish it asked for less permissions.
57a101565623ed112dfbe336;Clean The app is clean. No requirements for unnecessary permissions. I used it to delete some large unwanted files using disk space. What a pal Sally!
57a101565623ed112dfbe337;Secure sigh of relief Excellent option to replace unsavory standard communication options (w/little or no security or encryption for sms/mms and everything involved in message creation, carrier channels, and recipient reception, entire process for communication period, not just the pipe that the message itself travels on (as is with vpn only setups). Signal excels at making your communication as secure & shielded as practically possible, in todays false sense of privacy via personal communication standards.
57a101565623ed112dfbe338;Few problems, great otherwise From what I have seen the security and privacy are well implemented. There is a bit of a delay, but currently security and privacy come at a cost. I haven't found many bugs, the only glaring one is when you show all the apps you have open and slide to close Signal, the app sometimes pops back up or ends the screen where you can close apps.
57a101565623ed112dfbe339;Why does it always open on Root folder? I have not enabled root access, yet it always opens from root folder. I want it to always open from phone memory, and have the other tab as external sd card
57a101565623ed112dfbe33a;Love it. But please add a feature of locking device by pattern or pin. Because once we get notification , we have to unlock acdisplay and then phone pattern. This is quite annoying. So it'd be better if you guys provide pattern or pin lock. Awesome work at last.
57a101565623ed112dfbe33b;Minimalistic - but not perfect. Ac display is fantastic and goes extremely well with my launcher on my LG Leon. But every app can be improved. Some improvements that I'd recommend is attempting to remove the constant ac bar notification. Annoying for some android users but nothing too major. Last but not least, I really hope to see different security locks like, a pin number, enter a pattern or swipe to unlock. That has been a very wanted feature with this app and I hope the devs/dev add this in a future update, but for right now. Great

57a101565623ed112dfbe33e;A best and most reliable app! Appreciate how small yet mighty is this good app, with no added permissions. Thank you!
57a101565623ed112dfbe33f;Improve lockscreen Add the possibility to choose personal wallpaper like a photo and a security option like pin or pattern
57a101565623ed112dfbe340;Nice lockscreen! I used the lockscreen feature, and it looks well with the animation and the simple interface. Please add security option (pattern or pin) for the lockscreen, for the future update. Well done!
57a10a415623ed119350d0a0;Great Open Source Podcast App The only thing that would make it better is if the audio controls on my Pebble would interface with it. Might be a Pebble issue though
57a10a435623ed119350d0a1;Open Source is only way to be safe AND PROVE APPS AREN'T ABUSING PERMISSIONS YOU ACCEPT. THE MINIMAL HARM IS THE SALE OF UR INFO TO AD COMPANIES OR HACKERS IF U PAY FOR ANYTHING WITH PHONE. BEWARE PEOPLE AND STICK TO DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR REGION IN CASE ABUSE SO REPORT GETS RESPONSE. THIS APP IS GREAT AND NEEDS A DONATE METHOD. I'll pay a lot to open source developers. Google+ me for info or any open source developers. Lets start a movement for a better internet. I'm so serious ill put lots of money where my mouth ism
