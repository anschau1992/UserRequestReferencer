57a11b2a5623ed1242c2af78;My personal favorite XMPP+OTR app for Android, aside from a few minor issues I've had but have been able to solve. It allows for a large amount of customization for more advanced users while still remaining straightforward and simple to use for less advanced users. For the record, I've tried ChatSecure and Conversations too, but ChatSecure seems buggy and doesn't offer the option to not log conversations and Conversations has an issue where every time it disconnects, it gets stuck trying to load my contact list until I kill it and open it again.;RESSOURCES
